<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE RIDER OF THE BLACK HORSE</h3>
</div>

<p>The trail from the Diamond K broke around the
base of a low hill dotted thickly with scraggly oak
and fir, then stretched away, straight and almost level
(except for a deep cut where the railroad gang and a
steam shovel were eating into a hundred-foot hill) to
Manti. A month before, there had been no Manti, and
six months before that there had been no railroad. The
railroad and the town had followed in the wake of a
party of khaki-clad men that had made reasonably fast
progress through the country, leaving a trail of wooden
stakes and little stone monuments behind. Previously,
an agent of the railroad company had bartered through,
securing a right-of-way. The fruit of the efforts of
these men was a dark gash on a sun-scorched level,
and two lines of steel laid as straight as skilled eye and
transit could make them&mdash;and Manti.</p>
<p>Manti could not be overlooked, for the town obtruded
upon the vision from where &#8220;Brand&#8221; Trevison
was jogging along the Diamond K trail astride his big
black horse, Nigger. Manti dominated the landscape,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
not because it was big and imposing, but because it
was new. Manti&#8217;s buildings were scattered&mdash;there had
been no need for crowding; but from a distance&mdash;from
Trevison&#8217;s distance, for instance, which was a matter
of three miles or so&mdash;Manti looked insignificant, toy-like,
in comparison with the vast world on whose bosom
it sat. Manti seemed futile, ridiculous. But Trevison
knew that the coming of the railroad marked an epoch,
that the two thin, thread-like lines of steel were the
tentacles of the man-made monster that had gripped
the East&mdash;business reaching out for newer fields&mdash;and
that Manti, futile and ridiculous as it seemed, was an
outpost fortified by unlimited resource. Manti had
come to stay.</p>
<p>And the cattle business was going, Trevison knew.
The railroad company had built corrals at Manti, and
Trevison knew they would be needed for several years
to come. But he could foresee the day when they
would be replaced by building and factory. Business
was extending its lines, cattle must retreat before them.
Several homesteaders had already appeared in the
country, erecting fences around their claims. One of
the homesteaders, when Trevison had come upon him
a few days before, had impertinently inquired why
Trevison did not fence the Diamond K range. Fence
in five thousand acres! It had never been done in
this section of the country. Trevison had permitted
himself a cold grin, and had kept his answer to himself.
The incident was not important, but it foreshadowed
a day when a dozen like inquiries would make
the building of a range fence imperative.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span></p>
<p>Trevison already felt the irritation of congestion&mdash;the
presence of the homesteaders nettled him. He
frowned as he rode. A year ago he would have sold
out&mdash;cattle, land and buildings&mdash;at the market price.
But at that time he had not known the value of his
land. Now&mdash;</p>
<p>He kicked Nigger in the ribs and straightened in the
saddle, grinning.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not for sale now&mdash;eh, Nig?&#8221;</p>
<p>Five minutes later he halted the black at the crest
of the big railroad cut and looked over the edge appraisingly.
Fifty laborers&mdash;directed by a mammoth personage
in dirty blue overalls, boots, woolen shirt, and a
wide-brimmed felt hat, and with a face undeniably
Irish&mdash;were working frenziedly to keep pace with the
huge steam shovel, whose iron jaws were biting into
the earth with a regularity that must have been discouraging
to its human rivals. A train of flat-cars,
almost loaded, was on the track of the cut, and a dinky
engine attached to them wheezed steam from a safety
valve, the engineer and fireman lounging out of the
cab window, lazily watching.</p>
<p>Patrick Carson, the personage&mdash;construction boss,
good-natured, keen, observant&mdash;was leaning against
a boulder at the side of the track, talking to the engineer
at the instant Trevison appeared at the top of the cut.
He glanced up, his eyes lighting.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s thot mon, Trevison, ag&#8217;in, Murph&#8217;,&#8221; he
said to the engineer. &#8220;Bedad, he&#8217;s a pitcher now,
ain&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>An imposing figure Trevison certainly was. Horse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
and rider were outlined against the sky, and in the dear
light every muscle and feature of man and beast stood
but boldly and distinctly. The big black horse was a
powerful brute, tall and rangy, with speed and courage
showing plainly in contour, nostril and eye; and
with head and ears erect he stood motionless, statuesque,
heroic. His rider seemed to have been proportioned
to fit the horse. Tall, slender of waist,
broad of shoulder, straight, he sat loosely in the saddle
looking at the scene below him, unconscious of the
admiration he excited. Poetic fancies stirred Carson
vaguely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Luk at &#8217;im now, Murph; wid his big hat, his leather
pants, his spurs, an&#8217; the rist av his conthraptions!
There&#8217;s a divvil av a conthrast here now, if ye&#8217;d only
glimpse it. This civillyzation, ripraysinted be this railroad,
don&#8217;t seem to fit, noways. It&#8217;s like it had butted
into a pitcher book! Ain&#8217;t he a darlin&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen him up close,&#8221; said Murphy. There
was none of Carson&#8217;s enthusiasm in his voice. &#8220;It&#8217;s
always seemed to me that a felluh who rigs himself out
like that has got a lot of show-off stuff in him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The first time I clapped me eyes on wan av them
cowbhoys I thought so, too,&#8221; said Carson. &#8220;That was
back on the other section. But I seen so manny av
them rigged out like thot, thot I comminced to askin&#8217;
questions. It&#8217;s a domned purposeful rig, mon. The
big felt hat is a daisy for keepin&#8217; off the sun, an&#8217; that
gaudy bit av a rag around his neck keeps the sun and
sand from blisterin&#8217; the skin. The leather pants is
to keep his legs from gettin&#8217; clawed up be the thorns
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
av prickly pear an&#8217; what not, which he&#8217;s got to ride
through, an&#8217; the high heels is to keep his feet from
slippin&#8217; through the stirrups. A kid c&#8217;ud tell ye what
he carries the young cannon for, an&#8217; why he wears it
so low on his hip. Ye&#8217;ve nivver seen him up close, eh
Murph&#8217;? Well, I&#8217;m askin&#8217; him down so&#8217;s ye can have
a good look at him.&#8221; He stepped back from the
boulder and waved a hand at Trevison, shouting:</p>
<p>&#8220;Make it a real visit, bhoy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be pullin&#8217; out of here before he can get around,&#8221;
said Murphy, noting that the last car was almost filled.</p>
<p>Carson chuckled. &#8220;Hold tight,&#8221; he warned; &#8220;he&#8217;s
comin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>The side of the cut was steep, and the soft sand and
clay did not make a secure footing. But when the black
received the signal from Trevison he did not hesitate.
Crouching like a great cat at the edge, he slid his forelegs
over until his hoofs sank deep into the side of the
cut. Then with a gentle lurch he drew his hind legs
after him, and an instant later was gingerly descending,
his rider leaning far back in the saddle, the reins held
loosely in his hands.</p>
<p>It looked simple enough, the way the black was doing
it, and Trevison&#8217;s demeanor indicated perfect trust in
the animal and in his own skill as a rider. But the
laborers ceased working and watched, grouped, gesturing;
the staccato coughing of the steam shovel died
gaspingly, as the engineer shut off the engine and stood,
rooted, his mouth agape; the fireman in the dinky
engine held tightly to the cab window. Murphy muttered
in astonishment, and Carson chuckled admiringly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
for the descent was a full hundred feet, and there were
few men in the railroad gang that would have dared to
risk the wall on foot.</p>
<p>The black had gained impetus with distance. A third
of the slope had been covered when he struck some
loose earth that shifted with his weight and carried
his hind quarters to one side and off balance. Instantly
the rider swung his body toward the wall of the cut,
twisted in the saddle and swung the black squarely
around, the animal scrambling like a cat. The black
stood, braced, facing the crest of the cut, while the
dislodged earth, preceded by pebbles and small boulders,
clattered down behind him. Then, under the
urge of Trevison&#8217;s gentle hand and voice, the black
wheeled again and faced the descent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t ride a horse down there for the damned
railroad!&#8221; declared Murphy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thrue for ye&mdash;ye c&#8217;udn&#8217;t,&#8221; grinned Carson.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man could ride anywhere with a horse like that!&#8221;
remarked the fireman, fascinated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye&#8217;d have brought a cropper in that slide, an&#8217; the
road wud be minus a coal-heaver!&#8221; said Carson.
&#8220;Wud ye luk at him now!&#8221;</p>
<p>The black was coming down, forelegs asprawl, his
hind quarters sliding in the sand. Twice as his fore-hoofs
struck some slight obstruction his hind quarters
lifted and he stood, balanced, on his forelegs, and each
time Trevison averted the impending catastrophe by
throwing himself far back in the saddle and slapping
the black&#8217;s hips sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a circus rider!&#8221; shouted Carson, gleefully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
&#8220;He&#8217;s got the coolest head of anny mon I iver seen!
He&#8217;s a divvil, thot mon!&#8221;</p>
<p>The descent was spectacular, but it was apparent
that Trevison cared little for its effect upon his audience,
for as he struck the level and came riding toward
Carson and the others, there was no sign of self-consciousness
in his face or manner. He smiled faintly,
though, as a cheer from the laborers reached his ears.
In the next instant he had halted Nigger near the dinky
engine, and Carson was introducing him to the engineer
and fireman.</p>
<p>Looking at Trevison &#8220;close up,&#8221; Murphy was constrained
to mentally label him &#8220;some man,&#8221; and he
regretted his deprecatory words of a few minutes
before. Plainly, there was no &#8220;show-off stuff&#8221; in
Trevison. His feat of riding down the wall of the cut
had not been performed to impress anyone; the look
of reckless abandon in the otherwise serene eyes that
held Murphy&#8217;s steadily, convinced the engineer that the
man had merely responded to a dare-devil impulse.
There was something in Trevison&#8217;s appearance that
suggested an entire disregard of fear. The engineer
had watched the face of a brother of his craft one night
when the latter had been driving a roaring monster
down a grade at record-breaking speed into a wall of
rain-soaked darkness out of which might thunder at
any instant another roaring monster, coming in the
opposite direction. There had been a mistake in orders,
and the train was running against time to make a
switch. Several times during the ride Murphy had
caught a glimpse of the engineer&#8217;s face, and the eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
had haunted him since&mdash;defiance of death, contempt
of consequences, had been reflected in them. Trevison&#8217;s
eyes reminded him of the engineer&#8217;s. But in Trevison&#8217;s
eyes was an added expression&mdash;cold humor.
The engineer of Murphy&#8217;s recollection would have met
death dauntlessly. Trevison would meet it no less
dauntlessly, but would mock at it. Murphy looked
long and admiringly at him, noting the deep chest, the
heavy muscles, the blue-black sheen of his freshly-shaven
chin and jaw under the tan; the firm, mobile
mouth, the aggressive set to his head. Murphy set his
age down at twenty-seven or twenty-eight. Murphy
was sixty himself&mdash;the age that appreciates, and
secretly envies, the virility of youth. Carson was complimenting
Trevison on his descent of the wall of the
cut.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a daisy rider, me bhoy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nigger&#8217;s a clever horse,&#8221; smiled Trevison. Murphy
was pleased that he was giving the animal the
credit. &#8220;Nigger&#8217;s well trained. He&#8217;s wiser than some
men. Tricky, too.&#8221; He patted the sleek, muscular
neck of the beast and the animal whinnied gently.
&#8220;He&#8217;s careful of his master, though,&#8221; laughed Trevison.
&#8220;A man pulled a gun on me, right after I&#8217;d got
Nigger. He had the drop, and he meant business. I
had to shoot. To disconcert the fellow, I had to jump
Nigger against him. Since then, whenever Nigger sees
a gun in anyone&#8217;s hand, he thinks it&#8217;s time to bowl that
man over. There&#8217;s no holding him. He won&#8217;t even
stand for anyone pulling a handkerchief out of a hip
pocket when I&#8217;m on him.&#8221; Trevison grinned. &#8220;Try
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
it, Carson, but get that boulder between you and Nigger
before you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the look av the baste&#8217;s eye,&#8221; declined
the Irishman. &#8220;I wudn&#8217;t doubt ye&#8217;re worrud for the
wurrold. But he wudn&#8217;t jump a mon divvil a bit quicker
than his master, or I&#8217;m a sinner!&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevison&#8217;s eyes twinkled. &#8220;You&#8217;re a good construction
boss, Carson. But I&#8217;m glad to see that you&#8217;re getting
more considerate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Av what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of your men.&#8221; Trevison glanced back; he had
looked once before, out of the tail of his eye. The
laborers were idling in the cut, enjoying the brief rest,
taking advantage of Carson&#8217;s momentary dereliction,
for the last car had been filled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be rayported yet, begob!&#8221;</p>
<p>Carson waved his hands, and the laborers dove for
the flat-cars. When the last man was aboard, the
engine coughed and moved slowly away. Carson
climbed into the engine-cab, with a shout: &#8220;So-long
bhoy!&#8221; to Trevison. The latter held Nigger with a
firm rein, for the animal was dancing at the noise made
by the engine, and as the cars filed past him, running
faster now, the laborers grinned at him and respectfully
raised their hats. For they had come from one
of the Latin countries of Europe, and for them, in the
person of this heroic figure of a man who had ridden
his horse down the steep wall of the cut, was romance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>IN WHICH HATRED IS BORN</h3>
</div>

<p>For some persons romance dwells in the new and
the unusual, and for other persons it dwells not
at all. Certain of Rosalind Benham&#8217;s friends would
have been able to see nothing but the crudities and
squalor of Manti, viewing it as Miss Benham did,
from one of the windows of her father&#8217;s private car,
which early that morning had been shunted upon a
switch at the outskirts of town. Those friends would
have seen nothing but a new town of weird and picturesque
buildings, with more saloons than seemed to
be needed in view of the noticeable lack of citizens.
They would have shuddered at the dust-windrowed
street, the litter of refuse, the dismal lonesomeness, the
forlornness, the utter isolation, the desolation. Those
friends would have failed to note the vast, silent reaches
of green-brown plain that stretched and yawned into
aching distances; the wonderfully blue and cloudless
sky that covered it; they would have overlooked the
timber groves that spread here and there over the
face of the land, with their lure of mystery. No
thoughts of the bigness of this country would have
crept in upon them&mdash;except as they might have been
reminded of the dreary distance from the glitter and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
the tinsel of the East. The mountains, distant and
shining, would have meant nothing to them; the strong,
pungent aroma of the sage might have nauseated them.</p>
<p>But Miss Benham had caught her first glimpse of
Manti and the surrounding country from a window of
her berth in the car that morning just at dawn, and
she loved it. She had lain for some time cuddled up
in her bed, watching the sun rise over the distant mountains,
and the breath of the sage, sweeping into the
half-opened window, had carried with it something
stronger&mdash;the lure of a virgin country.</p>
<p>Aunt Agatha Benham, chaperon, forty&mdash;maiden
lady from choice&mdash;various uncharitable persons hinted
humorously of pursued eligibles&mdash;found Rosalind gazing
ecstatically out of the berth window when she stirred
and awoke shortly after nine. Agatha climbed out of
her berth and sat on its edge, yawning sleepily.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Manti, I suppose,&#8221; she said acridly, shoving
the curtain aside and looking out of the window.
&#8220;We should consider ourselves fortunate not to have
had an adventure with Indians or outlaws. We have
<i>that</i> to be thankful for, at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>Agatha&#8217;s sarcasm failed to penetrate the armor of
Rosalind&#8217;s unconcern&mdash;as Agatha&#8217;s sarcasms always
did. Agatha occupied a place in Rosalind&#8217;s affections,
but not in her scheme of enjoyment. Since she <i>must</i>
be chaperoned, Agatha was acceptable to her. But
that did not mean that she made a confidante of Agatha.
For Agatha was looking at the world through the eyes
of Forty, and the vision of Twenty is somewhat more
romantic.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever your father thought of in permitting
you to come out here is a mystery to me,&#8221; pursued
Agatha severely, as she fussed with her hair. &#8220;It was
like him, though, to go to all this trouble&mdash;for me&mdash;merely
to satisfy your curiosity about the country. I
presume we shall be returning shortly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be impatient, Aunty,&#8221; said the girl, still gazing
out of the window. &#8220;I intend to stretch my legs
before I return.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy!&#8221; gasped Agatha; &#8220;such language! This
barbaric country has affected you already, my dear.
Legs!&#8221; She summoned horror into her expression,
but it was lost on Rosalind, who still gazed out of the
window. Indeed, from a certain light in the girl&#8217;s eyes
it might be adduced that she took some delight in shocking
Agatha.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall stay here quite some time, I think,&#8221; said
Rosalind. &#8220;Daddy said there was no hurry; that he
might come out here in a month, himself. And I have
been dying to get away from the petty conventionalities
of the East. I am going to be absolutely human for
a while, Aunty. I am going to &#8216;rough it&#8217;&mdash;that is, as
much as one can rough it when one is domiciled in a
private car. I am going to get a horse and have a look
at the country. And Aunty&mdash;&#8221; here the girl&#8217;s voice
came chokingly, as though some deep emotion agitated
her &#8220;&mdash;I am going to ride &#8216;straddle&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not look to see whether Agatha had survived
this second shock&mdash;but Agatha had survived
many such shocks. It was only when, after a silence of
several minutes, Agatha spoke again, that the girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
seemed to remember there was anybody in the compartment
with her. Agatha&#8217;s voice was laden with
contempt:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know what you see in this outlandish
place to compensate for what you miss at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl did not look around. &#8220;A man on a black
horse, Aunty,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He has passed here twice.
I have never seen such a horse. I don&#8217;t remember to
have ever seen a man quite like the rider. He looks
positively&mdash;er&mdash;<i>heroish</i>! He is built like a Roman
gladiator, he rides the black horse as though he had
been sculptured on it, and his head has a set that makes
one feel he has a mind of his own. He has furnished
me with the only thrill that I have felt since we left
New York!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t seen <i>you</i>!&#8221; said Agatha, coldly; &#8220;of
course you made sure of <i>that</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked mischievously at the older woman.
She ran her fingers through her hair&mdash;brown and vigorous-looking&mdash;then
shaded her eyes with her hands
and gazed at her reflection in a mirror near by. In
deshabille she looked fresh and bewitching. She had
looked like a radiant goddess to &#8220;Brand&#8221; Trevison,
when he had accidentally caught a glimpse of her face
at the window while she had been watching him. He
had not known that the lady had just awakened from
her beauty sleep. He would have sworn that she
needed no beauty sleep. And he had deliberately ridden
past the car again, hoping to get another glimpse
of her. The girl smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not so positive about that, Aunty. Let us
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
not be prudish. If he saw me, he made no sign, and
therefore he is a gentleman.&#8221; She looked out of the
window and smiled again. &#8220;There he is now, Aunty!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Agatha who parted the curtains, this time.
The horseman&#8217;s face was toward the window, and he
saw her. An expression of puzzled astonishment
glowed in his eyes, superseded quickly by disappointment,
whereat Rosalind giggled softly and hid her
tousled head in a pillow.</p>
<p>&#8220;The impertinent brute! Rosalind, he dared to
look directly at me, and I am sure he would have
winked at me in another instant! A gentleman!&#8221; she
said, coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be severe, Aunty. I&#8217;m sure he is a gentleman,
for all his curiosity. See&mdash;there he is, riding
away without so much as looking back!&#8221;</p>
<p>Half an hour later the two women entered the dining-room
just as a big, rather heavy-featured, but handsome
man, came through the opposite door. He
greeted both ladies effusively, and smilingly looked at
his watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;You over-slept this morning, ladies&mdash;don&#8217;t you
think? It&#8217;s after ten. I&#8217;ve been rummaging around
town, getting acquainted. It&#8217;s rather an unfinished
place, after the East. But in time&mdash;&#8221; He made a
gesture, perhaps a silent prophecy that one day Manti
would out-strip New York, and bowed the ladies to
seats at table, talking while the colored waiter moved
obsequiously about them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought at first that your father was over-enthusiastic
about Manti, Miss Benham,&#8221; he continued.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
&#8220;But the more I see of it the firmer becomes my conviction
that your father was right. There are tremendous
possibilities for growth. Even now it is a
rather fertile country. We shall make it hum, once
the railroad and the dam are completed. It is a logical
site for a town&mdash;there is no other within a hundred
miles in any direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you are to anticipate the town&#8217;s growth&mdash;isn&#8217;t
that it, Mr. Corrigan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You put it very comprehensively, Miss Benham;
but perhaps it would be better to say that I am the
advance agent of prosperity&mdash;that sounds rather less
mercenary. We must not allow the impression to get
abroad that mere money is to be the motive power
behind our efforts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But money-making is the real motive, after all?&#8221;
said Miss Benham, dryly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I submit there are several driving forces in life,
and that money-making is not the least compelling of
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The other forces?&#8221; It seemed to Corrigan that
Miss Benham&#8217;s face was very serious. But Agatha,
who knew Rosalind better than Corrigan knew her,
was aware that the girl was merely demurely sarcastic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Love and hatred are next,&#8221; he said, slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would place money-making before love?&#8221;
Rosalind bantered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Money adds the proper flavor to love,&#8221; laughed
Corrigan. The laugh was laden with subtle significance
and he looked straight at the girl, a deep fire
slumbering in his eyes. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said slowly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
&#8220;money-making is a great passion. I have it. But I
can hate, and love. And when I do either, it will be
strongly. And then&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Agatha cleared her throat impatiently. Corrigan
colored slightly, and Miss Benham smothered something,
artfully directing the conversation into less personal
channels:</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going to build manufactories, organize
banks, build municipal power-houses, speculate in real
estate, and such things, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And build a dam. We already have a bank here,
Miss Benham.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will father be interested in those things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Silently. You understand, that being president of
the railroad, your father must keep in the background.
The actual promoting of these enterprises will be done
by me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Benham looked dreamily out of the window.
Then she turned to Corrigan and gazed at him meditatively,
though the expression in her eyes was so
obviously impersonal that it chilled any amorous emotion
that Corrigan might have felt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you are right,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It must be
thrilling to feel a conscious power over the destiny of
a community, to direct its progress, to manage it, and&mdash;er&mdash;figuratively
to grab industries by their&mdash;&#8221;
She looked slyly at Agatha &#8220;&mdash;lower extremities and
shake the dollars out of them. Yes,&#8221; she added,
with a wistful glance through the window; &#8220;that must
be more exciting than being merely in love.&#8221;</p>
<p>Agatha again followed Rosalind&#8217;s gaze and saw the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
black horse standing in front of a store. She frowned,
and observed stiffly:</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me that the people in these small
places&mdash;such as Manti&mdash;are not capable of managing
the large enterprises that Mr. Corrigan speaks of.&#8221;
She looked at Rosalind, and the girl knew that she was
deprecating the rider of the black horse. Rosalind
smiled sweetly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am sure there must be <i>some</i> intelligent persons
among them!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a rule,&#8221; stated Corrigan, dogmatically, &#8220;the
first citizens of any town are an uncouth and worthless
set.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Four Hundred would take exception to that!&#8221;
laughed Rosalind.</p>
<p>Corrigan laughed with her. &#8220;You know what I
mean, of course. Take Manti, for instance. Or any
new western town. The lowest elements of society are
represented; most of the people are very ignorant and
criminal.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked sharply at Corrigan, though he was
not aware of the glance. Was there a secret understanding
between Corrigan and Agatha? Had
Corrigan also some knowledge of the rider&#8217;s pilgrimages
past the car window? Both had maligned the
rider. But the girl had seen intelligence on the face
of the rider, and something in the set of his head had
told her that he was not a criminal. And despite his
picturesque rigging, and the atmosphere of the great
waste places that seemed to envelop him, he had made
a deeper impression on her than had Corrigan, darkly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
handsome, well-groomed, a polished product of polite
convention and breeding, whom her father wanted her
to marry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, looking at the black horse; &#8220;I
intend to observe Manti&#8217;s citizens more closely before
attempting to express an opinion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Half an hour later, in response to Corrigan&#8217;s invitation,
Rosalind was walking down Manti&#8217;s one street,
Corrigan beside her. Corrigan had donned khaki clothing,
a broad, felt hat, boots, neckerchief. But in spite
of the change of garments there was a poise, an atmosphere
about him, that hinted strongly of the graces of
civilization. Rosalind felt a flash of pride in him. He
was big, masterful, fascinating.</p>
<p>Manti seemed to be fraudulent, farcical, upon closer
inspection. For one thing, its crudeness was more glaring,
and its unpainted board fronts looked flimsy, transient.
Compared to the substantial buildings of the
East, Manti&#8217;s structures were hovels. Here was the
primitive town in the first flush of its creation. Miss
Benham did not laugh, for a mental picture rose before
her&mdash;a bit of wild New England coast, a lowering sky,
a group of Old-world pilgrims shivering around a
blazing fire in the open, a ship in the offing. That also
was a band of first citizens; that picture and the one
made by Manti typified the spirit of America.</p>
<p>There were perhaps twenty buildings. Corrigan took
her into several of them. But, she noted, he did not
take her into the store in front of which was the black
horse. She was introduced to several of the proprietors.
Twice she overheard parts of the conversation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
carried on between Corrigan and the proprietors. In
each case the conversation was the same:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you own this property?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The building.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who owns the land?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A company in New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan introduced himself as the manager of the
company, and spoke of erecting an office. The two
men spoke about their &#8220;leases.&#8221; The latter seemed
to have been limited to two months.</p>
<p>&#8220;See me before your lease expires,&#8221; she heard Corrigan
tell the men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does the railroad own the town site?&#8221; asked Rosalind
as they emerged from the last store.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And leases are going to be more valuable
presently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that you are going to extort money
from them&mdash;after they have gone to the expense of
erecting buildings?&#8221;</p>
<p>His smile was pleasant. &#8220;They will be treated with
the utmost consideration, Miss Benham.&#8221;</p>
<p>He ushered her into the bank. Like the other
buildings, the bank was of frame construction. Its
only resemblance to a bank was in the huge safe that
stood in the rear of the room, and a heavy wire netting
behind which ran a counter. Some chairs and a desk
were behind the counter, and at the desk sat a man
of probably forty, who got up at the entrance of his
visitors and approached them, grinning and holding
out a hand to Corrigan.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re here at last, Jeff,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
the car on the switch this morning. The show will
open pretty soon now, eh?&#8221; He looked inquiringly
at Rosalind, and Corrigan presented her. She heard
the man&#8217;s name, &#8220;Mr. Crofton Braman,&#8221; softly
spoken by her escort, and she acknowledged the introduction
formally and walked to the door, where she
stood looking out into the street.</p>
<p>Braman repelled her&mdash;she did not know why. A
certain crafty gleam of his eyes, perhaps, strangely
blended with a bold intentness as he had looked at her;
a too effusive manner; a smoothly ingratiating smile&mdash;these
evidences of character somehow made her link
him with schemes and plots.</p>
<p>She did not reflect long over Braman. Across the
street she saw the rider of the black horse standing
beside the animal at a hitching rail in front of the
store that Corrigan had passed without entering.
Viewed from this distance, the rider&#8217;s face was more
distinct, and she saw that he was good-looking&mdash;quite
as good-looking as Corrigan, though of a different type.
Standing, he did not seem to be so tall as Corrigan,
nor was he quite so bulky. But he was lithe and powerful,
and in his movements, as he unhitched the black
horse, threw the reins over its head and patted its neck,
was an ease and grace that made Rosalind&#8217;s eyes sparkle
with admiration.</p>
<p>The rider seemed to be in no hurry to mount his
horse. The girl was certain that twice as he patted
the animal&#8217;s neck he stole glances at her, and a stain
appeared in her cheeks, for she remembered the car
window.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>And then she heard a voice greet the rider. A man
came out of the door of one of the saloons, glanced
at the rider and raised his voice, joyously:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if it ain&#8217;t ol&#8217; &#8216;Brand&#8217;! Where in hell you
been keepin&#8217; yourself? I ain&#8217;t seen you for a week!&#8221;</p>
<p>Friendship was speaking here, and the girl&#8217;s heart
leaped in sympathy. She watched with a smile as the
other man reached the rider&#8217;s side and wrung his hand
warmly. Such effusiveness would have been thought
hypocritical in the East; humanness was always
frowned upon. But what pleased the girl most was
this evidence that the rider was well liked. Additional
evidence on this point collected quickly. It came from
several doors, in the shapes of other men who had
heard the first man&#8217;s shout, and presently the rider
was surrounded by many friends.</p>
<p>The girl was deeply interested. She forgot Braman,
Corrigan&mdash;forgot that she was standing in the doorway
of the bank. She was seeing humanity stripped of
conventionalities; these people were not governed by
the intimidating regard for public opinion that so effectively
stifled warm impulses among the persons she
knew.</p>
<p>She heard another man call to him, and she found
herself saying: &#8220;&#8216;Brand&#8217;! What an odd name!&#8221; But
it seemed to fit him; he was of a type that one sees
rarely&mdash;clean, big, athletic, virile, magnetic. His personality
dominated the group; upon him interest centered
heavily. Nor did his popularity appear to destroy
his poise or make him self-conscious. The girl watched
closely for signs of that. Had he shown the slightest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
trace of self-worship she would have lost interest in
him. He appeared to be a trifle embarrassed, and that
made him doubly attractive to her. He bantered gayly
with the men, and several times his replies to some
quip convulsed the others.</p>
<p>And then while she dreamily watched him, she heard
several voices insist that he &#8220;show Nigger off.&#8221; He
demurred, and when they again insisted, he spoke lowly
to them, and she felt their concentrated gaze upon her.
She knew that he had declined to &#8220;show Nigger off&#8221;
because of her presence. &#8220;Nigger,&#8221; she guessed, was
his horse. She secretly hoped he would overcome his
prejudice, for she loved the big black, and was certain
that any performance he participated in would be well
worth seeing. So, in order to influence the rider she
turned her back, pretending not to be interested. But
when she heard exclamations of satisfaction from the
group of men she wheeled again, to see that the rider
had mounted and was sitting in the saddle, grinning
at a man who had produced a harmonica and was rubbing
it on a sleeve of his shirt, preparatory to placing
it to his lips.</p>
<p>The rider had gone too far now to back out, and
Rosalind watched him in frank curiosity. And in the
next instant, when the strains of the harmonica smote
the still morning air, Nigger began to prance.</p>
<p>What followed reminded the girl of a scene in the
ring of a circus. The horse, proud, dignified, began
to pace slowly to the time of the accompanying music,
executing difficult steps that must have tried the patience
of both animal and trainer during the teaching period;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
the rider, lithe, alert, proud also, smiling his pleasure.</p>
<p>Rosalind stood there long, watching. It was a
clever exhibition, and she found herself wondering
about the rider. Had he always lived in the West?</p>
<p>The animal performed a dozen feats of the circus
arena, and the girl was so deeply interested in him that
she did not observe Corrigan when he emerged from
the bank, stepped down into the street and stood watching
the rider. She noticed him though, when the black,
forced to her side of the street through the necessity
of executing a turn, passed close to the easterner. And
then, with something of a shock, she saw Corrigan
smiling derisively. At the sound of applause from the
group on the opposite side of the street, Corrigan&#8217;s
derision became a sneer. Miss Benham felt resentment;
a slight color stained her cheeks. For she could
not understand why Corrigan should show displeasure
over this clean and clever amusement. She was looking
full at Corrigan when he turned and caught her gaze.
The light in his eyes was positively venomous.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a rather dramatic bid for your interest, isn&#8217;t
it, Miss Benham?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His voice came during a lull that followed the
applause. It reached Rosalind, full and resonant. It
carried to the rider of the black horse, and glancing sidelong
at him, Rosalind saw his face whiten under the
deep tan upon it. It carried, too, to the other side
of the street, and the girl saw faces grow suddenly
tense; noted the stiffening of bodies. The flat, ominous
silence that followed was unreal and oppressive. Out
of it came the rider&#8217;s voice as he urged the black to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
point within three or four paces of Corrigan and sat
in the saddle, looking at him. And now for the first
time Rosalind had a clear, full view of the rider&#8217;s face
and a quiver of trepidation ran over her. For the lean
jaws were corded, the mouth was firm and set&mdash;she
knew his teeth were clenched; it was the face of a
man who would not be trifled with. His chin was
shoved forward slightly; somehow it helped to express
the cold humor that shone in his narrowed, steady eyes.
His voice, when he spoke to Corrigan, had a metallic
quality that rang ominously in the silence that had
continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Back up your play or take it back,&#8221; he said slowly.</p>
<p>Corrigan had not changed his position. He stared
fixedly at the rider; his only sign of emotion over the
latter&#8217;s words was a quickening of the eyes. He idly
tapped with his fingers on the sleeve of his khaki shirt,
where the arm passed under them to fold over the
other. His voice easily matched the rider&#8217;s in its quality
of quietness:</p>
<p>&#8220;My conversation was private. You are interfering
without cause.&#8221;</p>
<p>Watching the rider, filled with a sudden, breathless
premonition of impending tragedy, Rosalind saw his
eyes glitter with the imminence of physical action. Distressed,
stirred by an impulse to avert what threatened,
she took a step forward, speaking rapidly to Corrigan:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Corrigan, this is positively silly! You know
you were hardly discreet!&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan smiled coldly, and the girl knew that it
was not a question of right or wrong between the two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
men, but a conflict of spirit. She did not know that
hatred had been born here; that instinctively each knew
the other for a foe, and that this present clash was to
be merely one battle of the war that would be waged
between them if both survived.</p>
<p>Not for an instant did Corrigan&#8217;s eyes wander from
those of the rider. He saw from them that he might
expect no further words. None came. The rider&#8217;s
right hand fell to the butt of the pistol that swung
low on his right hip. Simultaneously, Corrigan&#8217;s hand
dropped to his hip pocket.</p>
<p>Rosalind saw the black horse lunge forward as though
propelled by a sudden spring. A dust cloud rose from
his hoofs, and Corrigan was lost in it. When the
dust swirled away, Corrigan was disclosed to the girl&#8217;s
view, doubled queerly on the ground, face down. The
black horse had struck him with its shoulder&mdash;he
seemed to be badly hurt.</p>
<p>For a moment the girl stood, swaying, looking around
appealingly, startled wonder, dismay and horror in her
eyes. It had happened so quickly that she was stunned.
She had but one conscious emotion&mdash;thankfulness that
neither man had used his pistol.</p>
<p>No one moved. The girl thought some of them
might have come to Corrigan&#8217;s assistance. She did
not know that the ethics forbade interference, that a
fight was between the fighters until one acknowledged
defeat.</p>
<p>Corrigan&#8217;s face was in the dust; he had not moved.
The black horse stood, quietly now, several feet distant,
and presently the rider dismounted, walked to Corrigan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
and turned him over. He worked the fallen man&#8217;s
arms and legs, and moved his neck, then knelt and
listened at his chest. He got up and smiled mirthlessly
at the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s just knocked out, Miss Benham. It&#8217;s nothing
serious. Nigger&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You coward!&#8221; she interrupted, her voice thick with
passion.</p>
<p>His lips whitened, but he smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nigger&mdash;&#8221; he began again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coward! Coward!&#8221; she repeated, standing rigid
before him, her hands clenched, her lips stiff with scorn.</p>
<p>He smiled resignedly and turned away. She stood
watching him, hating him, hurling mental anathemas
after him, until she saw him pass through the doorway
of the bank. Then she turned to see Corrigan just
getting up.</p>
<p>Not a man in the group across the street had moved.
They, too, had watched Trevison go into the bank, and
now their glances shifted to the girl and Corrigan.
Their sympathies, she saw plainly, were with Trevison;
several of them smiled as the easterner got to his feet.</p>
<p>Corrigan was pale and breathless, but he smiled at
her and held her off when she essayed to help him
brush the dust from his clothing. He did that himself,
and mopped his face with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t fair,&#8221; whispered the girl, sympathetically.
&#8220;I almost wish that you had killed him!&#8221; she added,
vindictively.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, what a fire-eater!&#8221; he said with a broad smile.
She thought he looked handsomer with the dust upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
him, than he had ever seemed when polished and
immaculate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you badly hurt?&#8221; she asked, with a concern
that made him look quickly at her.</p>
<p>He laughed and patted her arm lightly. &#8220;Not a bit
hurt,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come, those men are staring.&#8221;</p>
<p>He escorted her to the step of the private car, and
lingered a moment there to make his apology for his
part in the trouble. He told her frankly, that he was
to blame, knowing that Trevison&#8217;s action in riding him
down would more than outweigh any resentment she
might feel over his mistake in bringing about the clash
in her presence.</p>
<p>She graciously forgave him, and a little later she
entered the car alone; he telling her that he would be
in presently, after he returned from the station where
he intended to send a telegram. She gave him a smile,
standing on the platform of the car, dazzling, eloquent
with promise. It made his heart leap with exultation,
and as he went his way toward the station he voiced a
sentiment:</p>
<p>&#8220;Entirely worth being ridden down for.&#8221;</p>
<p>But his jaws set savagely as he approached the station.
He did not go into the station, but around the
outside wall of it, passing between it and another building
and coming at last to the front of the bank building.
He had noted that the black horse was still
standing in front of the bank building, and that the
group of men had dispersed. The street was deserted.</p>
<p>Corrigan&#8217;s movements became quick and sinister.
He drew a heavy revolver out of a hip pocket, shoved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
its butt partly up his sleeve and concealed the cylinder
and barrel in the palm of his hand. Then he stepped
into the door of the bank. He saw Trevison standing
at one of the grated windows of the wire netting, talking
with Braman. Corrigan had taken several steps
into the room before Trevison heard him, and then
Trevison turned, to find himself looking into the gaping
muzzle of Corrigan&#8217;s pistol.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t run,&#8221; said the latter. &#8220;Thought it was
all over, I suppose. Well, it isn&#8217;t.&#8221; He was grinning
coldly, and was now deliberate and unexcited, though
two crimson spots glowed in his cheeks, betraying the
presence of passion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t reach for that gun!&#8221; he warned Trevison.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll blow a hole through you if you wriggle a finger!&#8221;
Watching Trevison, he spoke to Braman: &#8220;You got a
back room here?&#8221;</p>
<p>The banker stepped around the end of the counter
and opened a door behind the wire netting. &#8220;Right
here,&#8221; he directed.</p>
<p>Corrigan indicated the door with a jerking movement
of the head. &#8220;Move!&#8221; he said shortly, to Trevison.
The latter&#8217;s lips parted in a cold, amused grin, and he
hesitated slightly, yielding presently.</p>
<p>An instant later the three were standing in the middle
of a large room, empty except for a cot upon which
Braman slept, some clothing hanging on the walls, a
bench and a chair. Corrigan ordered the banker to
clear the room. When that had been done, Corrigan
spoke again to the banker:</p>
<p>&#8220;Get his gun.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></p>
<p>A snapping alertness of the eyes indicated that Trevison
knew what was coming. That was the reason he
had been so quiescent this far; it was why he made no
objection when Braman passed his hands over his clothing
in search of other weapons, after his pistol had
been lifted from its holster by the banker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now get out of here and lock the doors!&#8221; ordered
Corrigan. &#8220;And let nobody come in!&#8221;</p>
<p>Braman retired, grinning expectantly.</p>
<p>Then Corrigan backed away until he came to the
wall. Reaching far up, he hung his revolver on a
nail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he said to Trevison, his voice throaty from
passion; &#8220;take off your damned foolish trappings. I&#8217;m
going to knock hell out of you!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='major' />

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>BEATING A GOOD MAN</h3>
</div>

<p>Trevison had not moved. He had watched the
movements of the other closely, noting his huge
bulk, his lithe motions, the play of his muscles as he
backed across the room to dispose of the pistol. At
Corrigan&#8217;s words though, Trevison&#8217;s eyes glowed with
a sudden fire, his teeth gleamed, his straight lips parting
in a derisive smile. The other&#8217;s manner toward
him had twanged the chord of animosity that had been
between them since the first exchange of glances, and
he was as eager as Corrigan for the clash that must
now come. He had known that the first conflict had
been an unfinished thing. He laughed in sheer delight,
though that delight was tempered with savage determination.</p>
<p>&#8220;Save your boasts,&#8221; he taunted.</p>
<p>Corrigan sneered. &#8220;You won&#8217;t look so damned
attractive when you leave this room.&#8221; He took off
his hat and tossed it into a corner, then turned to Trevison
with an ugly grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ready?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite.&#8221; Trevison had not accepted Corrigan&#8217;s
suggestion about taking off his &#8220;damned foolish trappings,&#8221;
and he still wore them&mdash;cartridge belt, leather
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
chaps, spurs. But now he followed Corrigan&#8217;s lead and
threw his hat from him. Then he crouched and faced
Corrigan.</p>
<p>They circled cautiously, Trevison&#8217;s spurs jingling
musically. Then Trevison went in swiftly, jabbing with
his left, throwing off Corrigan&#8217;s vicious counter with
the elbow, and ripping his right upward. The fist met
Corrigan&#8217;s arm as the latter blocked, and the shock
forced both men back a step. Corrigan grinned with
malicious interest and crowded forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you&#8217;re not a novice. I
hope you&#8217;re not a quitter. I&#8217;ve quite a bit to hand you
for riding me down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevison grinned derisively, but made no answer.
He knew he must save his wind for this man. Corrigan
was strong, clever; his forearm, which had blocked
Trevison&#8217;s uppercut, had seemed like a bar of steel.</p>
<p>Trevison went in again with the grim purpose of
discovering just how strong his antagonist was. Corrigan
evaded a stiff left jab intended for his chin, and
his own right cross missed as Trevison ducked into a
clinch. With arms locked they strained, legs braced,
their lungs heaving as they wrestled, doggedly.</p>
<p>Corrigan stood like a post, not giving an inch. Vainly
Trevison writhed, seeking a position which would
betray a weakened muscle, but though he exerted every
ounce of his own mighty strength Corrigan held him
even. They broke at last, mutually, and Corrigan
must have felt the leathery quality of Trevison&#8217;s muscles,
for his face was set in serious lines. His eyes
glittered malignantly as he caught a confident smile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
on Trevison&#8217;s lips, and he bored in silently, swinging
both hands.</p>
<p>Trevison had been the cool boxer, carefully trying
out his opponent. He had felt little emotion save that
of self-protection. At the beginning of the fight he
would have apologized to Corrigan&mdash;with reservations.
Now he was stirred with the lust of battle.
Corrigan&#8217;s malignance had struck a responsive passion
in him, and the sodden impact of fist on flesh, the matching
of strength against strength, the strain of iron
muscles, the contact of their bodies, the sting and
burn of blows, had aroused the latent savage in him.
He was still cool, however, but it was the crafty coolness
of the trained fighter, and as Corrigan crowded
him he whipped in ripping blows that sent the big man&#8217;s
head back. Corrigan paid little heed to the blows; he
shook them off, grunting. Blood was trickling thinly
from his lips; he spat bestially over Trevison&#8217;s shoulder
in a clinch, and tried to sweep the latter from his
feet.</p>
<p>The agility of the cow-puncher saved him, and he
went dancing out of harm&#8217;s way, his spurs jingling.
Corrigan was after him with a rush. A heavy blow
caught Trevison on the right side of the neck just below
the ear and sent him, tottering, against the wall of the
building, from which he rebounded like a rubber ball,
smothering Corrigan with an avalanche of deadening
straight-arm punches that brought a glassy stare into
Corrigan&#8217;s eyes. The big man&#8217;s head wabbled, and
Trevison crowded in, intent on ending the fight quickly,
but Corrigan covered instinctively, and when Trevison
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
in his eagerness missed a blow, the big man clinched
with him and hung on doggedly until his befoggled
brain could clear. For a few minutes they rocked
around the room, their heels thudding on the bare
boards of the floor, creating sounds that filtered through
the enclosing walls and smote the silence of the outside
world with resonant rumblings. Mercilessly, Trevison
hammered at the heavy head that sought a haven on
his shoulder. Corrigan had been stunned and wanted
no more long range work. He tried to lock his big
arms around the other&#8217;s waist in an attempt to wrestle,
realizing that in that sort of a contest lay his only
hope of victory, but Trevison, agile, alert to his danger,
slipped elusively from the grasping hands and
thudded uppercuts to the other&#8217;s mouth and jaws that
landed with sickening force. But none of the blows
landed on a vital spot, and Corrigan hung grimly on.</p>
<p>At last, lashing viciously, wriggling, squirming,
swinging around in a wide circle to get out of Corrigan&#8217;s
clutches, Trevison broke the clinch and stood off,
breathing heavily, summoning his reserve strength for
a finishing blow. Corrigan had been fearfully punished
during the last few minutes, but he was gradually
recovering from his dizziness, and he grinned hideously
at Trevison through his smashed lips. He surged forward,
reminding Trevison of a wounded bear, but
Trevison retreated warily as he measured the distance
from which he would drive the blow that would end
it</p>
<p>He was still retreating, describing a wide circle. He
swung around toward the door through which Braman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
had gone&mdash;his back was toward it. He did not see
the door open slightly as he passed; he had not seen
Braman&#8217;s face in the slight crevice that had been
between door and jamb all along. Nor did he see the
banker jab at his legs with the handle of a broom.
But he felt the handle hit his legs. It tripped him,
forcing him to lose his balance. As he fell he saw
Corrigan&#8217;s eyes brighten, and he twisted sideways to
escape a heavy blow that Corrigan aimed at him. He
only partially evaded it&mdash;it struck him glancingly, a
little to the left of the chin, stunning him, and he fell
awkwardly, his left arm doubling under him. The
agonizing pain that shot through the arm as he crumpled
to the floor told him that it had been broken at
the wrist. A queer stupor came upon him, during
which he neither felt nor saw. Dimly, he sensed that
Corrigan was striking at him; with a sort of vague
half-consciousness he felt that the blows were landing.
But they did not hurt, and he laughed at Corrigan&#8217;s
futile efforts. The only feeling he had was a blind
rage against Braman, for he was certain that it had
been the banker who had tripped him. Then he saw
the broom on the floor and the crevice in the doorway.
He got to his feet some way, Corrigan hanging to
him, raining blows upon him, and he laughed aloud as,
his vision clearing a little, he saw Corrigan&#8217;s mouth,
weak, open, drooling blood, and remembered that when
Braman had tripped him Corrigan had hardly been in
shape to do much effective hitting. He tottered away
from Corrigan, taunting him, though afterwards he
could not remember what his words were. Also, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
heard Corrigan cursing him, though he could never
remember <i>his</i> words, either. He tried to swing his
left arm as Corrigan came within range of it, but
found he could not lift it, and so ducked the savage
blow that Corrigan aimed at him and slipped sideways,
bringing his right into play. Several times as they
circled he uppercut Corrigan with the right, he retreating,
side-stepping; Corrigan following him doggedly,
slashing venomously at him, hitting him occasionally.
Corrigan could not hurt him, and he could not resist
laughing at Corrigan&#8217;s face&mdash;it was so hideously
repulsive.</p>
<p>A man came out of the front door of Hanrahan&#8217;s
saloon across the street from the bank building, and
stood in the street for a moment, looking about him.
Had Miss Benham seen the man she would have recognized
him as the one who had previously come out
of the saloon to greet the rider with: &#8220;Well, if it ain&#8217;t
ol&#8217; &#8216;Brand&#8217;!&#8221; He saw the black horse standing in
front of the bank building, but Trevison was nowhere
in sight. The man mumbled: &#8220;I don&#8217;t want him to git
away without me seein&#8217; him,&#8221; and crossed the street to
the bank window and peered inside. He saw Braman
peering through a half-open door at the rear of the
banking room, and he heard sounds&mdash;queer, jarring
sounds that made the glass window in front of him
rattle and quiver.</p>
<p>He dove around to the side of the building and
looked in a window. He stood for a moment, watching
with bulging eyes, half drew a pistol, thought better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
of the notion and replaced it, and then darted back to
the saloon from which he had emerged, croaking
hoarsely: &#8220;Fight! fight!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Trevison had not had the agility to evade one of
Corrigan&#8217;s heavy blows. It had caught him as he had
tried to duck, striking fairly on the point of the jaw,
and he was badly dazed. But he still grinned mockingly
at his enemy as the latter followed him, tensed,
eager, snarling. He evaded other blows that would
have finished him&mdash;through instinct, it seemed to Corrigan;
and though there was little strength left in
him he kept working his right fist through Corrigan&#8217;s
guard and into his face, pecking away at it until it
seemed to be cut to ribbons.</p>
<p>Voices came from somewhere in the banking room,
voices raised in altercation. Neither of the two men,
raging around the rear room, heard them&mdash;they had
become insensate savages oblivious of their surroundings,
drunken with passion, with the blood-mania gripping
their brains.</p>
<p>Trevison had brought the last ounce of his remaining
strength into play and had landed a crushing blow
on Corrigan&#8217;s chin. The big man was wabbling crazily
about in the general direction of Trevison, swinging his
arms wildly, Trevison evading him, snapping home
blows that landed smackingly without doing much damage.
They served merely to keep Corrigan in the
semi-comatose state in which Trevison&#8217;s last hard blow
had left him. And that last blow had sapped Trevison&#8217;s
strength; his spirit alone had survived the drunken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
orgy of rage and hatred. As the tumult around him
increased&mdash;the tramp of many feet, scuffling; harsh,
discordant voices, curses, yells of protest, threats&mdash;not
a sound of which he heard, so intent was he with
his work of battering his adversary, he ceased to retreat
from Corrigan, and as the latter shuffled toward him he
stiffened and drove his right fist into the big man&#8217;s
face. Corrigan cursed and grunted, but lunged forward
again. They swung at the same instant&mdash;Trevison&#8217;s
right just grazing Corrigan&#8217;s jaw; Corrigan&#8217;s
blow, full and sweeping, thudding against Trevison&#8217;s
left ear. Trevison&#8217;s head rolled, his chin sagged to his
chest, and his knees doubled like hinges. Corrigan
smirked malevolently and drove forward again. But
he was too eager, and his blows missed the reeling target
that, with arms hanging wearily at his sides, still
instinctively kept to his feet, the taunting smile, now
becoming bitterly contemptuous, still on his face. It
meant that though exhausted, his arm broken, he felt
only scorn for Corrigan&#8217;s prowess as a fighter.</p>
<p>Fighting off the weariness he lunged forward again,
swinging the now deadened right arm at the blur Corrigan
made in front of him. Something collided with
him&mdash;a human form&mdash;and thinking it was Corrigan,
clinching with him, he grasped it. The momentum of
the object, and his own weakness, carried him back
and down, and with the object in his grasp he fell,
underneath, to the floor. He saw a face close to his&mdash;Braman&#8217;s&mdash;and
remembering that the banker had
tripped him, he began to work his right fist into the
other&#8217;s face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>He would have finished Braman. He did not know
that the man who had greeted him as &#8220;ol&#8217; &#8216;Brand&#8217;&#8221;
had smashed the banker in the forehead with the butt
of a pistol when the banker had tried to bar his progress
at the doorway; he was not aware that the force of
the blow had hurled Braman against him, and that the
latter, half unconscious, was not defending himself.
He would not have cared had he known these things,
for he was fighting blindly, doggedly, recklessly&mdash;fighting
two men, he thought. And though he sensed
that there could be but one end to such a struggle, he
hammered away with ferocious malignance, and in
the abandon of his passion in this extremity he was
recklessly swinging his broken left arm, driving it at
Braman, groaning each time the fist landed.</p>
<p>He felt hands grasping him, and he fought them
off, smashing weakly at faces that appeared around
him as he was dragged to his feet. He heard a voice
say: &#8220;His arm&#8217;s bruk,&#8221; and the voice seemed to clear
the atmosphere. He paused, holding back a blow, and
the dancing blur of faces assumed a proper aspect and
he saw the man who had hit the banker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello Mullarky!&#8221; he grinned, reeling drunkenly
in the arms of his friends. &#8220;Come to see the picnic?
Where&#8217;s my&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw Corrigan leaning against a wall of the room
and lurched toward him. A dozen hands held him
back&mdash;the room was full of men; and as his brain
cleared he recognized some of them. He heard threats,
mutterings, against Corrigan, and he laughed, bidding
the men to hold their peace, that it was a &#8220;fair fight.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
Corrigan was unmoved by the threats&mdash;as he was
unmoved by Trevison&#8217;s words. He leaned against the
wall, weak, his arms hanging at his sides, his face macerated,
grinning contemptuously. And then, despite his
objections, Trevison was dragged away by Mullarky
and the others, leaving Braman stretched out on the
floor, and Corrigan, his knees sagging, his chin almost
on his chest, standing near the wall. Trevison turned
as he was forced out of the door, and grinned tauntingly
at his tired enemy. Corrigan spat at him.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, his damaged arm bandaged, and
some marks of the battle removed, Trevison was in
the banking room. He had forbidden any of his friends
to accompany him, but Mullarky and several others
stood outside the door and watched him.</p>
<p>A bandage around his head, Braman leaned on the
counter behind the wire netting, pale, shaking. In a
chair at the desk sat Corrigan, glowering at Trevison.
The big man&#8217;s face had been attended to, but it was
swollen frightfully, and his smashed lips were in a
horrible pout. Trevison grinned at him, but it was to
the banker that he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want my gun, Braman,&#8221; he said, shortly.</p>
<p>The banker took it out of a drawer and silently
shoved it across the counter and through a little opening
in the wire netting. The banker watched, fearingly,
as Trevison shoved the weapon into its holster. Corrigan
stolidly followed his movements.</p>
<p>The gun in its holster, Trevison leaned toward the
banker.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I always knew you weren&#8217;t straight, Braman. But
we won&#8217;t quarrel about that now. I just want you to
know that when this arm of mine is right again, we&#8217;ll
try to square things between us. Broom handles will
be barred that day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Braman was silent and uneasy as he watched Trevison
reach into a pocket and withdraw a leather bill-book.
From this he took a paper and tossed it in
through the opening of the wire netting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cash it,&#8221; he directed. &#8220;It&#8217;s about the matter we
were discussing when we were interrupted by our bloodthirsty
friend, there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at Corrigan while Braman examined the
paper, his eyes alight with the mocking, unfearing
gleam that had been in them during the fight. Corrigan
scowled and Trevison grinned at him&mdash;the indomitable,
mirthless grin of the reckless fighting man; and
Corrigan filled his lungs slowly, watching him with
half-closed eyes. It was as though both knew that
a distant day would bring another clash between them.</p>
<p>Braman fingered the paper uncertainly, and looked
at Corrigan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose this is all regular?&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
ought to know something about it&mdash;it&#8217;s a check from
the railroad company for the right-of-way through Mr.
Trevison&#8217;s land.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan&#8217;s eyes brightened as he examined the check.
They filled with a hard, sinister light.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it isn&#8217;t regular.&#8221; He took the
check from Braman and deliberately tore it into small
pieces, scattering them on the floor at his feet. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
smiled vindictively, settling back into his chair.
&#8220;&#8216;Brand&#8217; Trevison, eh?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, Mr. Trevison,
the railroad company isn&#8217;t ready to close with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevison had watched the destruction of the check
without the quiver of an eyelash. A faint, ironic smile
curved the corners of his mouth as Corrigan concluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; he said quietly. &#8220;You were not man
enough to beat me a little while ago&mdash;even with the
help of Braman&#8217;s broom. You&#8217;re going to take it out
on me through the railroad; you&#8217;re going to sneak and
scheme. Well, you&#8217;re in good company&mdash;anything
that you don&#8217;t know about skinning people Braman will
tell you. But I&#8217;m letting you know this: The railroad
company&#8217;s option on my land expired last night, and
it won&#8217;t be renewed. If it&#8217;s fight you&#8217;re looking for,
I&#8217;ll do my best to accommodate you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan grunted, and idly drummed with the fingers
of one hand on the top of the desk, watching Trevison
steadily. The latter opened his lips to speak, changed
his mind, grinned and went out. Corrigan and Braman
watched him as he stopped for a moment outside
to talk with his friends, and their gaze followed him
until he mounted Nigger and rode out of town. Then
the banker looked at Corrigan, his brows wrinkling.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know your business, Jeff,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but
you&#8217;ve picked a tough man in Trevison.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan did not answer. He was glowering at the
pieces of the check that lay on the floor at his feet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE LONG ARM OF POWER</h3>
</div>

<p>Presently Corrigan lit a cigar, biting the end
off carefully, to keep it from coming in contact
with his bruised lips. When the cigar was going well,
he looked at Braman.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is Trevison?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pale, still dizzy from the effects of the blow on the
head, Braman, who was leaning heavily on the counter,
smiled wryly:</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a holy terror&mdash;you ought to know that. He&#8217;s
a reckless, don&#8217;t-give-a-damn fool who has forgotten
there&#8217;s such a thing as consequences. &#8216;Firebrand&#8217;
Trevison, they call him. And he lives up to what that
means. The folks in this section of the country swear
by him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan made a gesture of impatience. &#8220;I mean&mdash;what
does he do? Of course I know he owns some
land here. But how much land does he own?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw the figure on the check, didn&#8217;t you? He
owns five thousand acres.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long has he been here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got me. More than ten years, I guess,
from what I can gather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What was he before he came here?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t even surmise that&mdash;he don&#8217;t talk about
his past. From the way he waded into you, I should
judge he was a prize fighter before becoming a cow-puncher.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan glared at the banker. &#8220;Yes; it&#8217;s damned
funny,&#8221; he said. &#8220;How did he get his land?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Proved on a quarter-section. Bought the rest of
it&mdash;and bought it mighty cheap.&#8221; Braman&#8217;s eyes
brightened. &#8220;Figure on attacking <i>his</i> title?&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan grunted. &#8220;I notice he asked you for cash.
You&#8217;re not his banker, evidently.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He banks in Las Vegas, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about his cattle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He shipped three thousand head last season.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How big is his outfit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got about twenty men. They&#8217;re all hard cases&mdash;like
him, and they&#8217;d shoot themselves for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan got up and walked to the window, from
where he looked out at Manti. The town looked like
an army camp. Lumber, merchandise, supplies of
every description, littered the street in mounds and scattered
heaps, awaiting the erection of tent-house and
building. But there was none of that activity that
might have been expected from the quantity of material
on hand; it seemed that the owners were waiting,
delaying in anticipation of some force that would give
them encouragement. They were reluctant to risk their
money in erecting buildings on the strength of mere
rumor. But they had come, hoping.</p>
<p>Corrigan grinned at Braman. &#8220;They&#8217;re afraid to
take a chance,&#8221; he said, meaning Manti&#8217;s citizens.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t blame them. I&#8217;ve spread the stuff around&mdash;as
you told me. That&#8217;s all they&#8217;ve heard. They&#8217;re
here on a forlorn hope. The boom they are looking
for, seems, from present conditions, to be lurking somewhere
in the future, shadowed by an indefiniteness that
to them is vaguely connected with somebody&#8217;s promise
of a dam, agricultural activity to follow, and factories.
They haven&#8217;t been able to trace the rumors, but they&#8217;re
here, and they&#8217;ll make things hum if they get a chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; grinned Corrigan. &#8220;A boom town is always
a graft for first arrivals. That is, boom towns <i>have</i>
been. But Manti&mdash;&#8221; He paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, different,&#8221; chuckled the banker. &#8220;It must
have cost a wad to shove that water grant through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Benham kicked on the price&mdash;it was enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That maximum rate clause is a pippin. You can
soak them the limit right from the jump.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And scare them out,&#8221; scoffed Corrigan. &#8220;That
isn&#8217;t the game. Get them here, first. Then&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The banker licked his lips. &#8220;How does old Benham
take it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Benham is enthusiastic because everything will
be done in a perfectly legitimate way&mdash;he thinks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the courts?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judge Lindman, of the District Court now in Dry
Bottom, is going to establish himself here. Benham
pulled that string.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Braman. &#8220;When is Lindman coming?&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan&#8217;s smile was crooked; it told eloquently of
conscious power over the man he had named.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll come whenever I give the word. Benham&#8217;s
got something on him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You always were a clever son-of-a-gun!&#8221; laughed
the banker, admiringly.</p>
<p>Ignoring the compliment, Corrigan walked into the
rear room, where he gazed frowningly at his reflection
in a small glass affixed to the wall. Re-entering
the banking room he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in no condition to face Miss Benham. Go
down to the car and tell her that I shall be very busy
here all day, and that I won&#8217;t be able to see her until
late tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Benham&#8217;s name was on the tip of the banker&#8217;s
tongue, but, glancing at Corrigan&#8217;s face, he decided that
it was no time for that particular brand of levity. He
grabbed his hat and stepped out of the front door.</p>
<p>Left alone, Corrigan paced slowly back and forth in
the room, his brows furrowed thoughtfully. Trevison
had become an important figure in his mind. Corrigan
had not hinted to Braman, to Trevison, or to Miss
Benham, of the actual situation&mdash;nor would he. But
during his first visit to town that morning he had stood
in one of the front windows of a saloon across the
street. He had not been getting acquainted, as he had
told Miss Benham, for the saloon had been the first
place that he had entered, and after getting a drink
at the bar he had sauntered to the window. From there
he had seen &#8220;Brand&#8221; Trevison ride into town, and
because Trevison made an impressive figure he had
watched him, instinctively aware that in the rider of the
black horse was a quality of manhood that one meets
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
rarely. Trevison&#8217;s appearance had caused him a throb
of disquieting envy.</p>
<p>He had noticed Trevison&#8217;s start upon getting his
first glimpse of the private car on the siding. He had
followed Trevison&#8217;s movements carefully, and with
increased disquiet. For, instead of dismounting and
going into a saloon or a store, Trevison had urged
the black on, past the private car, which he had examined
leisurely and intently. The clear morning air
made objects at a distance very distinct, and as Trevison
had ridden past the car, Corrigan had seen a flutter at
one of the windows; had caught a fleeting glimpse of
Rosalind Benham&#8217;s face. He had seen Trevison ride
away, to return for a second view of the car a few
minutes later. At breakfast, Corrigan had not failed
to note Miss Benham&#8217;s lingering glances at the black
horse, and again, in the bank, with her standing at
the door, he had noticed her interest in the black horse
and its rider. His quickly-aroused jealousy and hatred
had driven him to the folly of impulsive action, a
method which, until now, he had carefully evaded.
Yes, he had found &#8220;Brand&#8221; Trevison a worthy antagonist&mdash;Braman
had him appraised correctly.</p>
<p>Corrigan&#8217;s smile was bitter as he again walked into
the rear room and surveyed his reflection in the glass.
Disgusted, he turned to one of the windows and looked
out. From where he stood he could see straight down
the railroad tracks to the cut, down the wall of which,
some hours before, Trevison had ridden the black
horse. The dinky engine, with its train of flat-cars, was
steaming toward him. As he watched, engine and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
cars struck the switch and ran onto the siding, where
they came to a stop. Corrigan frowned and looked at
his watch. It lacked fully three hours to quitting time,
and the cars were empty, save for the laborers draped
on them, their tools piled in heaps. While Corrigan
watched, the laborers descended from the cars and
swarmed toward their quarters&mdash;a row of tent-houses
near the siding. A big man&mdash;Corrigan knew him
later as Patrick Carson&mdash;swung down from the engine-cab
and lumbered toward the little frame station house,
in a window of which the telegrapher could be seen,
idly scanning a week-old newspaper. Carson spoke
shortly to the telegrapher, at which the latter motioned
toward the bank building and the private car. Then
Carson came toward the bank building. An instant
later, Carson came in the front door and met Corrigan
at the wire netting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hullo,&#8221; said the Irishman, without preliminaries;
&#8220;the agent was tellin&#8217; me I&#8217;d find a mon named Corrigan
here. You&#8217;re in charge, eh?&#8221; he added at Corrigan&#8217;s
affirmative. &#8220;Well, bedad, somebody&#8217;s got to
be in charge from now on. The Willie-boy engineer
from who I&#8217;ve been takin&#8217; me orders has sneaked away
to Dry Bottom for a couple av days, shovin&#8217; the raysponsibility
on me&mdash;an&#8217; I ain&#8217;t feelin&#8217; up to it. I&#8217;m a
daisy construction boss, if I do say it meself, but I ain&#8217;t
enough of a fightin&#8217; mon to buck the business end av a
six-shooter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe you&#8217;d know&mdash;he said you&#8217;d be sure to.
I&#8217;ve been parleyin&#8217; wid a fello&#8217; named &#8216;Firebrand&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
Trevison, an&#8217; I&#8217;m that soaked wid perspiration that me
boots is full av it, after me thryin&#8217; to urge him to be
dacently careful wid his gun!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; asked Corrigan, darkly.</p>
<p>&#8220;This mon Trevison came down through the cut this
mornin&#8217;, goin&#8217; to town. He was pleasant as a mon
who&#8217;s had a raise in wages, an&#8217; he was joshin&#8217; wid us.
A while ago he comes back from town, an&#8217; he&#8217;s that
cold an&#8217; polite that he&#8217;d freeze ye while he&#8217;s takin&#8217;
his hat off to ye. One av his arms is busted, an&#8217; he&#8217;s
got a welt or two on his face. But outside av that he&#8217;s
all right. He rides down into the cut where we&#8217;re all
workin&#8217; fit to kill ourselves. He halts his big black
horse about forty or fifty feet away from the ol&#8217; rattle-box
that runs the steam shovel, an&#8217; he grins like a tiger
at me an&#8217; says:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Carson, I&#8217;m wantin&#8217; you to pull your min off. I
can&#8217;t permit anny railroad min on the Diamond K
property. You&#8217;re a friend av mine, an&#8217; all that, but
you&#8217;ll have to pull your freight. You&#8217;ve got tin minutes.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;I&#8217;ve got me orders to do this work,&#8217; I says&mdash;begging
his pardon.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Here&#8217;s your orders to stop doin&#8217; it!&#8217; he comes
back. An&#8217; I was inspectin&#8217; the muzzle av his six-shooter.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ye wudn&#8217;t shoot a mon for doin&#8217; his duthy?&#8217; I
says.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Thry me,&#8217; he says. &#8216;You&#8217;re trespassers. The
railroad company didn&#8217;t come through wid the coin
for the right-of-way. Your mon, Corrigan, has got an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
idee that he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to bluff me. I&#8217;m callin&#8217; his bluff.
You&#8217;ve got tin minutes to get out av here. At the
end av that time I begin to shoot. I&#8217;ve got six cattridges
in the gun, an&#8217; fifty more in the belt around
me middle. An&#8217; I seldom miss whin I shoot. It&#8217;s up
to you whether I start a cemetery here or not,&#8217; he says,
cold an&#8217; ca&#8217;mlike.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ginneys knowed somethin&#8217; was up, an&#8217; they
crowded around. I thought Trevison was thryin&#8217; to
run a bluff on <i>me</i>, an&#8217; I give orders for the ginneys to
go back to their work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trevison didn&#8217;t say another word, but at the end
av the tin minutes he grins that tiger grin av his an&#8217;
busts the safety valve on the rattle-box wid a shot
from his pistol. He smashes the water-gauge wid
another, an&#8217; jammed one shot in the ol&#8217; rattle-box&#8217;s
entrails, an&#8217; she starts to blow off steam&mdash;&mdash;shriekin&#8217;
like a soul in hell. The ginneys throwed down their
tools an&#8217; started to climb up the walls of the cut like
a gang av monkeys, Trevison watchin&#8217; thim with a
grin as cold as a barrow ful ov icicles. Murph&#8217;, the
engineer av the dinky, an&#8217; his fireman, ducks for the
engine-cab, l&#8217;avin&#8217; me standin&#8217; there to face the music.
Trevison yells at the engineer av the rattle-box, an&#8217;
he disappears like a rat into a hole. Thin Trevison
swings his gun on me, an&#8217; I c&#8217;u&#8217;d feel me knees knockin&#8217;
together. &#8216;Carson,&#8217; he says, &#8216;I hate like blazes to do
it, but you&#8217;re the boss here, an&#8217; these min will do what
you tell thim to do. Tell thim to get to hell out of
here an&#8217; not come back, or I&#8217;ll down you, sure as me
name&#8217;s Trevison!&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m old enough to know from lookin&#8217; at a mon
whether he manes business or not, an&#8217; Trevison wasn&#8217;t
foolin&#8217;. So I got the bhoys away, an&#8217; here we are. If
you&#8217;re in charge, it&#8217;s up to you to smooth things out.
Though from the looks av your mug &#8216;Firebrand&#8217;s&#8217;
been maulin&#8217; you some, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan&#8217;s answer was a cold glare. &#8220;You quit
without a fight, eh?&#8221; he taunted; &#8220;you let one man
bluff half a hundred of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Carson&#8217;s eyes brightened. &#8220;My recollection is that
&#8216;Firebrand&#8217; is still holdin&#8217; the forrt. Whin I got me
last look at him he was sittin&#8217; on the top av the cut,
like he was intendin&#8217; to stay there indefinite. If ye
think he&#8217;s bluffin&#8217;, mebbe it&#8217;d be quite an idee for you
to go out there yourself, an&#8217; call it. I&#8217;d be willin&#8217; to
give ye me moral support.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call him when I get ready.&#8221; Corrigan went to
the desk and sat in the chair, ignoring Carson, who
watched him narrowly. Presently he turned and spoke
to the man:</p>
<p>&#8220;Put your men at work trueing up the roadbed on
the next section back, until further orders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; let &#8216;Firebrand&#8217; hold the forrt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do as you&#8217;re told!&#8221;</p>
<p>Carson went out to his men. Near the station platform
he turned and looked back at the bank building,
grinning. &#8220;There&#8217;s two bulldogs comin&#8217; to grips in
this deal or I&#8217;m a domn poor prophet!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>When Braman returned from his errand he found
Corrigan staring out of the window. The banker
announced that Miss Benham had received Corrigan&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
message with considerable equanimity, and was rewarded
for his levity with a frown.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Carson and his gang doing in town?&#8221; he
queried.</p>
<p>Corrigan told him, briefly. The banker whistled
in astonishment, and his face grew long. &#8220;I told you
he is a tough one!&#8221; he reminded.</p>
<p>Corrigan got to his feet. &#8220;Yes&mdash;he&#8217;s a tough
one,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;I&#8217;m forced to alter my plans a
little&mdash;that&#8217;s all. But I&#8217;ll get him. Hunt up something
to eat,&#8221; he directed; &#8220;I&#8217;m hungry. I&#8217;m going
to the station for a few minutes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went out, and the banker watched him until he
vanished around the corner of a building. Then Braman
shook his head. &#8220;Jeff&#8217;s resourceful,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But Trevison&mdash;&#8221; His face grew solemn. &#8220;What
a damned fool I was to trip him with that broom!&#8221;
He drew a pistol from a pocket and examined it
intently, then returned it to the pocket and sat, staring
with unseeing eyes beyond the station at the two
lines of steel that ran out upon the plains and stopped
in the deep cut on the crest of which he could see a man
on a black horse.</p>
<p>Down at the station Corrigan was leaning on a
rough wooden counter, writing on a yellow paper pad.
When he had finished he shoved the paper over to
the telegrapher, who had been waiting:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>J. Chalfant Benham</span>, B&mdash; Building, New York.</p>
<p>Unexpected opposition developed. Trevison. Give Lindman
removal order immediately. Communicate with me at
Dry Bottom tomorrow morning. <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Corrigan</span>.</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></div>
<p>Corrigan watched the operator send the message
and then he returned to the bank building, where he
found Braman setting out a meager lunch in the rear
room. The two men talked as they ate, mostly about
Trevison, and the banker&#8217;s face did not lose its worried
expression. Later they smoked and talked and watched
while the afternoon sun grew mellow; while the somber
twilight descended over the world and darkness
came and obliterated the hill on which sat the rider of
the black horse.</p>
<p>Shortly after dark Corrigan sent the banker on
another errand, this time to a boarding-house at the
edge of town. Braman returned shortly, announcing:
&#8220;He&#8217;ll be ready.&#8221; Then, just before midnight Corrigan
climbed into the cab of the engine which had brought
the private car, and which was waiting, steam up, several
hundred feet down the track from the car.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; said Corrigan briskly, to the engineer,
as he climbed in and a flare from the fire-box suffused
his face; &#8220;pull out. But don&#8217;t make any fuss
about it&mdash;I don&#8217;t want those people in the car to
know.&#8221; And shortly afterwards the locomotive glided
silently away into the darkness toward that town in
which a judge of the United States Court had, a few
hours before, received orders which had caused him
to remark, bitterly: &#8220;So does the past shape the
future.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>A TELEGRAM AND A GIRL</h3>
</div>

<p>Banker Braman went to bed on the cot in the
back room shortly after Corrigan departed from
Manti. He stretched himself out with a sigh,
oppressed with the conviction that he had done a bad
day&#8217;s work in antagonizing Trevison. The Diamond
K owner would repay him, he knew. But he knew, too,
that he need have no fear that Trevison would sneak
about it. Therefore he did not expect to feel Trevison
at his throat during the night. That was some satisfaction.</p>
<p>He dropped to sleep, thinking of Trevison. He
awoke about dawn to a loud hammering on the rear
door, and he scrambled out of bed and opened the
door upon the telegraph agent. That gentleman gazed
at him with grim reproof.</p>
<p>&#8220;Holy Moses!&#8221; he said; &#8220;you&#8217;re a hell of a tight
sleeper! I&#8217;ve been pounding on this door for an age!&#8221;
He shoved a sheet of paper under Braman&#8217;s nose.
&#8220;Here&#8217;s a telegram for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Braman took the telegram, scanning it, while the
agent talked on, ramblingly. A sickly smile came over
Braman&#8217;s face when he finished reading, and then he
listened to the agent:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I got a wire a little after midnight, asking me
if that man, Corrigan, was still in Manti. The engineer
told me he was taking Corrigan back to Dry
Bottom at midnight, and so I knew he wasn&#8217;t here, and
I clicked back &#8216;No.&#8217; It was from J. C. He must have
connected with Corrigan at Dry Bottom. That guy
Trevison must have old Benham&#8217;s goat, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Braman re-read the telegram; it was directed to him:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Send my daughter to Trevison with cash in amount of check
destroyed by Corrigan yesterday. Instruct her to say mistake
made. No offense intended. Hustle. <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>J. C. Benham.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Braman slipped his clothes on and ran down the
track to the private car. He had known J. C. Benham
several years and was aware that when he issued an
order he wanted it obeyed, literally. The negro autocrat
of the private car met him at the platform and
grinned amply at the banker&#8217;s request.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Benham done tol&#8217; me she am not to be disturbed
till eight o&#8217;clock,&#8221; he objected. But the telegram
in Braman&#8217;s hands had instant effect upon the
black custodian of the car, and shortly afterward Miss
Benham was looking at the banker and his telegram in
sleepy-eyed astonishment, the door of her compartment
open only far enough to permit her to stick her
head out.</p>
<p>Braman was forced to do much explaining, and concluded
by reading the telegram to her. She drew everything
out of him except the story of the fight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said in the end, &#8220;I suppose I shall have
to go. So his name is &#8216;Brand&#8217; Trevison. And he won&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
permit the men to work. Why did Mr. Corrigan
destroy the check?&#8221;</p>
<p>Braman evaded, but the girl thought she knew.
Corrigan had yielded to an impulse of obstinacy provoked
by Trevison&#8217;s assault on him. It was not good
business&mdash;it was almost childish; but it was human
to feel that way. She felt a slight disappointment in
Corrigan, though; the action did not quite accord with
her previous estimate of him. She did not know what
to think of Trevison. But of course any man who
would deliberately and brutally ride another man down,
would naturally not hesitate to adopt other lawless
means of defending himself.</p>
<p>She told Braman to have the money ready for her
in an hour, and at the end of that time with her morocco
handbag bulging, she emerged from the front door of
the bank and climbed the steps of the private car,
which had been pulled down to a point in front of
the station by the dinky engine, with Murphy presiding
at the throttle.</p>
<p>Carson was standing on the platform when Miss
Benham climbed to it, and he grinned and greeted her
with:</p>
<p>&#8220;If ye have no objections, ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;ll be ridin&#8217; down
to the cut with ye. Me name&#8217;s Patrick Carson, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no objection whatever,&#8221; said the lady, graciously.
&#8220;I presume you are connected with the railroad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; wid the ginneys that&#8217;s buildin&#8217; it, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; he
supplemented. &#8220;I&#8217;m the construction boss av this section,
an&#8217; I&#8217;m the mon that had the unhappy experience
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
av lookin&#8217; into the business end av &#8216;Firebrand&#8217;s&#8217; six-shooter
yisterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Firebrand&#8217;s&#8217;?&#8221; she said, with a puzzled look at
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thot mon, Trevison, ma&#8217;am; that&#8217;s what they call
him. An&#8217; he fits it bedad&mdash;beggin&#8217; your pardon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said; &#8220;then you know him.&#8221; And she
felt a sudden interest in Carson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough to be certain he ain&#8217;t to be monkeyed with,
ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed to ignore this. &#8220;Please tell the engineer
to go ahead,&#8221; she told him. &#8220;And then come into the
car&mdash;I want to talk with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>A little later, with the car clicking slowly over the
rail-joints toward the cut, Carson diffidently followed
the negro attendant into a luxurious compartment, in
which, seated in a big leather-covered chair, was Miss
Benham. She motioned Carson to another chair, and
in the conversation that followed Miss Benham received
a comprehensive estimate of Trevison from Carson&#8217;s
viewpoint. It seemed unsatisfying to her&mdash;Carson&#8217;s
commendation did not appear to coincide with Trevison&#8217;s
performances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you heard what happened in Manti yesterday?&#8221;
she questioned. &#8220;This man, Trevison, jumped
his horse against Mr. Corrigan and knocked him
down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard av it,&#8221; grinned Carson. &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t see
it. Nor did I see the daisy scrap that tuk place right
after.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fight?&#8221; she exclaimed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>Carson reddened. &#8220;Sure, ye haven&#8217;t heard av it, an&#8217;
I&#8217;m blabbin&#8217; like a kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me about it.&#8221; Her eyes were aglow with
interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s devilish little to tell&mdash;beggin&#8217; your pardon,
ma&#8217;am. But thim that was in at the finish is
waggin&#8217; their tongues about it bein&#8217; a dandy shindy.
Judgin&#8217; from the talk, nobuddy got licked&mdash;it was a
fair dhraw. But I sh&#8217;ud judge, lookin&#8217; at Corrigan&#8217;s
face, that it was a darlin&#8217; av a scrap.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was silent, gazing contemplatively out of the
car window. Corrigan had returned, after escorting
her to the car, to engage in a fight with Trevison. That
was what had occupied him; that was why he had gone
away without seeing her. Well, Trevison had given
him plenty of provocation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trevison&#8217;s horse knockin&#8217; Corrigan down was what
started it, they&#8217;ve been tellin&#8217; me,&#8221; said Carson. &#8220;But
thim that know Trevison&#8217;s black knows that Trevison
wasn&#8217;t to blame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to blame?&#8221; she asked; &#8220;why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the simple rayson thot in a case like thot the
mon has no control over the baste, ma&#8217;am. &#8216;Firebrand&#8217;
told me only yisterday mornin&#8217; thot there was no
holdin&#8217; the black whin somebuddy tried to shoot wid
him on his back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl remembered how Trevison had tried to
speak to her immediately after the upsetting of Corrigan,
and she knew now, that he had wanted to explain
his action. Reviewing the incident in the light of Carson&#8217;s
explanation, she felt that Corrigan was quite as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
much at fault as Trevison. Somehow, that knowledge
was vaguely satisfying.</p>
<p>She did not succeed in questioning Carson further
about Trevison, though there were many points over
which she felt a disturbing curiosity, for Agatha came
in presently, and after nodding stiffly to Carson, seated
herself and gazed aloofly out of a window.</p>
<p>Carson, ill at ease in Agatha&#8217;s presence, soon
invented an excuse to go out upon the platform, leaving
Rosalind to explain his presence in the car.</p>
<p>&#8220;What on earth could you have to say to a section
boss&mdash;or he to you?&#8221; demanded Agatha. &#8220;You are
becoming very&mdash;er&mdash;indiscreet, Rosalind.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl smiled. It was a smile that would have
betrayed the girl had Agatha possessed the physiognomist&#8217;s
faculty of analyzation, for in it was much
relief and renewed faith. For the rider of the black
horse was not the brutal creature she had thought him.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When the private car came to a stop, Rosalind looked
out of the window to see the steep wall of the cut
towering above her. Aunt Agatha still sat near, and
when Rosalind got up Agatha rose also, registering
an objection:</p>
<p>&#8220;I think your father might have arranged to have
some <i>man</i> meet this outlaw. It is not, in my opinion,
a proper errand for a girl. But if you are determined
to go, I presume I shall have to follow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be necessary,&#8221; said Rosalind. But Agatha
set her lips tightly. And when the girl reached the platform
Agatha was close behind her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>But both halted on the platform as they were about
to descend the steps. They heard Carson&#8217;s voice, loud
and argumentative:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lady aboored, I tell ye! If ye shoot,
you&#8217;re a lot of damned rapscallions, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll come up
there an&#8217; bate the head off ye!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stow your gab an&#8217; produce the lady!&#8221; answered a
voice. It came from above, and Rosalind stepped down
to the floor of the cut and looked upward. On the
crest of the southern wall were a dozen men&mdash;cowboys&mdash;armed
with rifles, peering down at the car.
They shifted their gaze to her when she stepped into
view, and one of them laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Correct, boys,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it&#8217;s a lady.&#8221; There was
a short silence; Rosalind saw the men gather close&mdash;they
were talking, but she could not hear their voices.
Then the man who had spoken first stepped to the edge
of the cut and called: &#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl answered: &#8220;I want to speak with Mr.
Trevison.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; came back the voice; &#8220;but Trevison
ain&#8217;t here&mdash;he&#8217;s at the Diamond K.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosalind reached a decision quickly. &#8220;Aunty,&#8221; she
said; &#8220;I am going to the Diamond K.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I forbid you!&#8221; said Agatha sternly. &#8220;I would
not trust you an instant with those outlaws!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; smiled Rosalind. &#8220;I am coming up,&#8221;
she called to the man on the crest; &#8220;do you mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man laughed. &#8220;I reckon not, ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosalind smiled at Carson, who was watching her
admiringly, and to the smile he answered, pointing eastward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
to where the slope of the hill melted into the
plains: &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to go thot way, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; He
laughed. &#8220;You&#8217;re perfectly safe wid thim min, ma&#8217;am&mdash;they&#8217;re
Trevison&#8217;s&mdash;an&#8217; Trevison wud shoot the
last mon av thim if they&#8217;d harm a hair av your pretty
head. Go along, ma&#8217;am, an&#8217; God bless ye! Ye&#8217;ll be
savin&#8217; a heap av throuble for me an&#8217; me ginneys, an&#8217;
the railroad company.&#8221; He looked with bland derision
at Agatha who gave him a glance of scornful reproof
as she followed after her charge.</p>
<p>The girl was panting when she reached the crest of
the cut. Agatha was a little white, possibly more from
apprehension than from indignation, though that emotion
had its influence; but their reception could not
have been more formal had it taken place in an eastern
drawing-room. For every hat was off, and each man
was trying his best to conceal his interest. And when
men have not seen a woman for a long time, the appearance
of a pretty one makes it rather hard to maintain
polite poise. But they succeeded, which spoke well
for their manliness. If they exchanged surreptitious
winks over the appearance of Agatha, they are to be
excused, for that lady&#8217;s demeanor was one of frigid
haughtiness, which is never quite impressive to those
who live close to nature.</p>
<p>In an exchange of words, brief and pointed, Rosalind
learned that it was three miles to the Diamond K
ranchhouse, and that Trevison had given orders not
to be disturbed unless the railroad company attempted
to continue work at the cut. Could she borrow one of
their horses, and a guide?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You bet!&#8221; emphatically returned the spokesman
who, she learned later, was Trevison&#8217;s foreman. She
should have the gentlest &#8220;cayuse&#8221; in the &#8220;bunch,&#8221;
and the foreman would do the guiding, himself. At
which word Agatha, noting the foreman&#8217;s enthusiasm,
glared coldly at him.</p>
<p>But here Agatha was balked by the insurmountable
wall of convention. She had ridden horses, to be sure,
in her younger days; but when the foreman, at Rosalind&#8217;s
request, offered her a pony, she sniffed scornfully
and marched down the slope toward the private
car, saying that if Rosalind was <i>determined</i> to persist
she might persist without <i>her</i> assistance. For there
was no side-saddle in the riding equipment of the outfit.
And Rosalind, quite aware of the prudishness
exhibited by her chaperon, and not unmindful of the
mirth that the men were trying their best to keep concealed,
rode on with the foreman, with something
resembling thankfulness for the temporary freedom
tugging at her heart.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Trevison had camped all night on the crest of the
cut. It was only at dawn that Barkwell, the foreman
who had escorted Rosalind, had appeared at the cut
on his way to town, and discovered him, and then the
foreman&#8217;s plans were changed and he was dispatched
to the Diamond K for reinforcements. Trevison had
ridden back to the Diamond K to care for his arm,
which had pained him frightfully during the night, and
at ten o&#8217;clock in the morning he was stretched out,
fully dressed and wide awake on the bed in his room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
in the ranchhouse, frowningly reviewing the events of
the day before.</p>
<p>He was in no good humor, and when he heard
Barkwell hallooing from the yard near the house, he
got up and looked out of a window, a scowl on his
face.</p>
<p>Rosalind was not in the best of spirits, herself, for
during the ride to the ranchhouse she had been sending
subtly-questioning shafts at the foreman&mdash;questions
that mostly concerned Trevison&mdash;and they had
all fell, blunted and impotent, from the armor of Barkwell&#8217;s
reticence. But a glance at Trevison&#8217;s face, ludicrous
in its expression of stunned amazement, brought
a broad smile to her own. She saw his lips form her
name, and then she waited demurely until she saw
him coming out of the ranchhouse door toward her.</p>
<p>He had quite recovered from his surprise, she noted;
his manner was that of the day before, when she had
seen him riding the black horse. When she saw him
coming lightly toward her, she at first had eyes for
nothing but his perfect figure, feeling the strength that
his close-fitting clothing revealed so unmistakably, and
an unaccountable blush glowed in her cheeks. And
then she observed that his left arm was in a sling, and
a flash of wondering concern swept over her&mdash;also
unaccountable. And then he was at her stirrup, smiling
up at her broadly and cordially.</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome to the Diamond K, Miss Benham,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you get off your horse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you; I came on business and must return
immediately. There has been a misunderstanding, my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
father says. He wired me, directing me to apologize,
for him, for Mr. Corrigan&#8217;s actions of yesterday. Perhaps
Mr. Corrigan over-stepped his authority&mdash;I have
no means of knowing.&#8221; She passed the morocco bag
over to him, and he took it, looking at it in some perplexity.
&#8220;You will find cash in there to the amount
named by the check that Mr. Corrigan destroyed. I
hope,&#8221; she added, smiling at him, &#8220;that there will be
no more trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The payment of this money for the right-of-way
removes the provocation for trouble,&#8221; he laughed.
&#8220;Barkwell,&#8221; he directed, turning to the foreman; &#8220;you
may go back to the outfit.&#8221; He looked after the foreman
as the latter rode away, turning presently to
Rosalind. &#8220;If you will wait a few minutes, until I
stow this money in a safe place, I&#8217;ll ride back to the
cut with you and pull the boys off.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had wondered much over the rifles in the hands
of his men at the cut. &#8220;Would your men have used
their guns?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>He had turned to go to the house, and he wheeled
quickly, astonished. &#8220;Certainly!&#8221; he said; &#8220;why
not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be lawlessness, would it not?&#8221; It
made her shiver slightly to hear him so frankly confess
to murderous designs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was not my quarrel,&#8221; he said, looking at her
narrowly, his brows contracted. &#8220;Law is all right
where everybody accepts it as a governor to their
actions. I accept it when it deals fairly with me&mdash;when
it&#8217;s just. Certain rights are mine, and I&#8217;ll fight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
for them. This situation was brought on by Corrigan&#8217;s
obstinacy. We had a fight, and it peeved him because
I wouldn&#8217;t permit him to hammer my head off. He
destroyed the check, and as the company&#8217;s option
expired yesterday it was unlawful for the company to
trespass on my land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she smiled, affected by his vehemence; &#8220;we
shall have peace now, presumably. And&mdash;&#8221; she reddened
again &#8220;&mdash;I want to ask your pardon on my own
account, for speaking to you as I did yesterday. I
thought you brutal&mdash;the way you rode your horse
over Mr. Corrigan. Mr. Carson assured me that the
horse was to blame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am indebted to Carson,&#8221; he laughed, bowing.
Rosalind watched him go into the house, and then
turned and inspected her surroundings. The house was
big, roomy, with a massive hip roof. A paved gallery
stretched the entire length of the front&mdash;she would
have liked to rest for a few minutes in the heavy rocker
that stood in its cool shadows. No woman lived here,
she was certain, because there was a lack of evidence
of woman&#8217;s handiwork&mdash;no filmy curtains at the windows&mdash;merely
shades; no cushion was on the chair&mdash;which,
by the way, looked lonesome&mdash;but perhaps that
was merely her imagination. Much dust had gathered
on the gallery floor and on the sash of the windows&mdash;a
woman would have had things looking differently.
And so she divined that Trevison was not married.
It surprised her to discover that that thought had been
in her mind, and she turned to continue her inspection,
filled with wonder that it had been there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>She got an impression of breadth and spaciousness
out of her survey of the buildings and the surrounding
country. The buildings were in good condition; everything
looked substantial and homelike and her contemplation
of it aroused in her a yearning for a house
and land in this section of the country, it was so peaceful
and dignified in comparison with the life she knew.</p>
<p>She watched Trevison when he emerged from the
house, and smiled when he returned the empty handbag.
He went to a small building near a fenced enclosure&mdash;the
corral, she learned afterward&mdash;and came
out carrying a saddle, which he hung on the fence
while he captured the black horse, which she had
already observed. The animal evaded capture, playfully,
but in the end it trotted mincingly to Trevison
and permitted him to throw the bridle on. Then,
shortly afterward he mounted the black and together
they rode back toward the cut.</p>
<p>As they rode the girl&#8217;s curiosity for the man who
rode beside her grew acute. She was aware&mdash;she
had been aware all along&mdash;that he was far different
from the other men of Manti&mdash;there was about him
an atmosphere of refinement and quiet confidence that
mingled admirably with his magnificent physical force,
tempering it, suggesting reserve power, hinting of excellent
mental capacity. She determined to know something
about him. And so she began subtly:</p>
<p>&#8220;In a section of country so large as this it seems
that our American measure of length&mdash;a mile&mdash;should
be stretched to something that would more adequately
express size. Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>He looked quickly at her. &#8220;That is an odd
thought,&#8221; he laughed, &#8220;but it inevitably attacks the
person who views the yawning distances here for the
first time. Why not use the English mile if the American
doesn&#8217;t satisfy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a measure that exceeds that, isn&#8217;t there?
Wasn&#8217;t there a Persian measure somewhat longer,
fathered by Herodotus or another of the ancients? I
am sure there was&mdash;or is&mdash;but I have forgotten?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;&mdash;a parasang.&#8221; He looked narrowly
at her and saw her eyes brighten.</p>
<p>She had made progress; she felt much satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not a native,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cowboys do not commonly measure their distances
with parasangs,&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor do ordinary women try to shake off ennui by
coming West in private cars,&#8221; he drawled.</p>
<p>She started and looking quickly at him. &#8220;How did
you know that was what happened to me?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you&#8217;re too spirited and vigorous to spend
your life dawdling in society. You yearn for action,
for the broad, free life of the open. You&#8217;re in love
with this country right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; she said, astonished; &#8220;but how do you
know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might have sent a man here in your place&mdash;Braman,
for instance; he could be trusted. You came
yourself, eager for adventure&mdash;you came on a borrowed
horse. When you were looking at the country
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
from the horse in front of my house, I saw you
sigh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, with flushed face and glowing
eyes; &#8220;I <i>have</i> decided to live out here&mdash;for a time,
at least. So you were watching me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a glance,&#8221; he defended, grinning; &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t
help it. Please forgive me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I&#8217;ll have to,&#8221; she laughed, delighted,
reveling in this freedom of speech, in his directness.
His manner touched a spark somewhere in her, she
felt strangely elated, exhilarated. When she reflected
that this was only their second meeting and that she
had not been conventionally introduced to him, she
was amazed. Had a stranger of her set talked to her
so familiarly she would have resented it. Out here it
seemed to be perfectly natural.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know I borrowed a horse to come
here?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy,&#8221; he grinned; &#8220;there&#8217;s the Diamond K
brand on his hip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode on a little distance in silence, and then
she remembered that she was still curious about him.
His frankness had affected her; she did not think it
impertinent to betray curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you lived out here?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;About ten years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You weren&#8217;t born here, of course&mdash;you have
admitted that. Then where did you come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a large country,&#8221; he returned, unsmilingly.</p>
<p>It was a reproof, certainly&mdash;Rosalind could go no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
farther in that direction. But her words had brought
a mystery into existence, thus sharpening her interest
in him. She was conscious, though, of a slight pique&mdash;what
possible reason could he have for evasion? He
had not the appearance of a fugitive from justice.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re going to live out here?&#8221; he said, after
an interval. &#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard father speak of buying Blakeley&#8217;s place.
Do you know where it is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It adjoins mine.&#8221; There was a leaping note in
his voice, which she did not fail to catch. &#8220;Do you
see that dark line over there?&#8221; He pointed eastward&mdash;a
mile perhaps. &#8220;That&#8217;s a gully; it divides
my land from Blakeley&#8217;s. Blakeley told me a month
ago that he was dickering with an eastern man. If
you are thinking of looking the place over, and want
a trustworthy escort I should be pleased to recommend&mdash;myself.&#8221;
And he grinned widely at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall consider your offer&mdash;and I thank you for
it,&#8221; she returned. &#8220;I feel positive that father will buy
a ranch here, for he has much faith in the future of
Manti&mdash;he is obsessed with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked sharply at her. &#8220;Then your father is
going to have a hand in the development of Manti?
I heard a rumor to the effect that some eastern company
was interested, had, in fact, secured the water
rights for an enormous section.&#8221;</p>
<p>She remembered what Corrigan had told her, and
blushingly dissembled:</p>
<p>&#8220;I put no faith in rumor&mdash;do you? Mr. Corrigan
is the head of the company which is to develop
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
Manti. But of course <i>that</i> is an eastern company,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded, and she smiled at a thought that came
to her. &#8220;How far is it to Blakeley&#8217;s ranchhouse?&#8221;
she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;About two parasangs,&#8221; he answered gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, mimicking him; &#8220;I could <i>never</i>
walk there, could I? If I go, I shall have to borrow a
horse&mdash;or buy one. Could you recommend a horse
that would be as trustworthy as the escort you have
promised me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall go to Blakeley&#8217;s tomorrow,&#8221; he told her.
&#8220;I shall bring you a trustworthy horse at ten o&#8217;clock
in the morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were approaching the cut, and she nodded an
acceptance. An instant later he was talking to his
men, and she sat near him, watching them as they
raced over the plains toward the Diamond K ranchhouse.
One man remained; he was without a mount,
and he grinned with embarrassment when Rosalind&#8217;s
gaze rested on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said; &#8220;you are waiting for your horse!
How stupid of me!&#8221; She dismounted and turned the
animal over to him. When she looked around, Trevison
had also dismounted and was coming toward her,
leading the black, the reins looped through his arm.
Rosalind flushed, and thought of Agatha, but offered
no objection.</p>
<p>It was a long walk down the slope of the hill and
around its base to the private car, but they made it
still longer by walking slowly and taking the most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
roundabout way. Three persons saw them coming&mdash;Agatha,
standing rigid on the platform; the negro
attendant, standing behind Agatha in the doorway,
his eyes wide with interest; and Carson, seated on a
boulder a little distance down the cut, grinning broadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bedad,&#8221; he rumbled; &#8220;the bhoy&#8217;s made a hit wid
her, or I&#8217;m a sinner! But didn&#8217;t I know he wud?
The two bulldogs is goin&#8217; to have it now, sure as I&#8217;m
a foot high!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A JUDICIAL PUPPET</h3>
</div>

<p>Bowling along over the new tracks toward
Manti in a special car secured at Dry Bottom by
Corrigan, one compartment of which was packed closely
with books, papers, ledger records, legal documents,
blanks, and even office furniture, Judge Lindman
watched the landscape unfold with mingled feelings
of trepidation, reluctance, and impotent regret. The
Judge&#8217;s face was not a strong one&mdash;had it been he
would not have been seated in the special car, talking
with Corrigan. He was just under sixty-five years,
and their weight seemed to rest heavily upon him.
His eyes were slightly bleary, and had a look of weariness,
as though he had endured much and was utterly
tired. His mouth was flaccid, the lips pouting when
he compressed his jaws, giving his face the sullen, indecisive
look of the brooder lacking the mental and physical
courage of independent action and initiative. The
Judge could be led; Corrigan was leading him now,
and the Judge was reluctant, but his courage had oozed,
back in Dry Bottom, when Corrigan had mentioned a
culpable action which the Judge had regretted many
times.</p>
<p>Some legal records of the county were on the table
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
between the two men. The Judge had objected when
Corrigan had secured them from the compartment
where the others were piled.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t regular, Mr. Corrigan,&#8221; he had said; &#8220;no
one except a legally authorized person has the right to
look over those books.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll say that I am legally authorized, then,&#8221;
grinned Corrigan. The look in his eyes was one of
amused contempt. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t the only irregular thing
you have done, Lindman.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge subsided, but back in his eyes was a
slumbering hatred for this man, who was forcing him
to complicity in another crime. He regretted that
other crime; why should this man deliberately remind
him of it?</p>
<p>After looking over the records, Corrigan outlined a
scheme of action that made the Judge&#8217;s face blanch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t be a party to any such scurrilous undertaking!&#8221;
he declared when, he could trust his voice;
&#8220;I&mdash;I won&#8217;t permit it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan stretched his legs out under the table,
shoved his hands into his trousers&#8217; pockets and laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why the high moral attitude, Judge? It doesn&#8217;t
become you. Refuse if you like. When we get to
Manti I shall wire Benham. It&#8217;s likely he&#8217;ll feel pretty
sore. He&#8217;s got his heart set on this. And I have
no doubt that after he gets my wire he&#8217;ll jump the
next train for Washington, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge exclaimed with weak incoherence, and a
few minutes later he was bending over the records
with Corrigan&mdash;the latter making sundry copies on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
a pad of paper, which he placed in a pocket when the
work was completed.</p>
<p>At noon the special car was in Manti. Corrigan, the
Judge, and Braman, carried the Judge&#8217;s effects and
stored them in the rear room of the bank building.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll build you a courthouse, tomorrow,&#8221; he promised
the Judge; &#8220;big enough for you and a number of
deputies. You&#8217;ll need deputies, you know.&#8221; He grinned
as the Judge shrank. Then, leaving the Judge in the
room with his books and papers, Corrigan drew Braman
outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got hell from Benham for destroying Trevison&#8217;s
check&mdash;he wired me to attend to my other deals and
let him run the railroad&mdash;the damned old fool! You
must have taken the cash to Trevison&mdash;I see the gang&#8217;s
working again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The cash went,&#8221; said the banker, watching Corrigan
covertly, &#8220;but I didn&#8217;t take it. J. C. wired
explicit orders for his daughter to act.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan cursed viciously, his face dark with wrath
as he turned to look at the private car, on the switch.
The banker watched him with secret, vindictive enjoyment.
Miss Benham had judged Braman correctly&mdash;he
was cold, crafty, selfish, and wholly devoid of sympathy.
He was for Braman, first and last&mdash;and in
the interim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Benham went to the cut&mdash;so I hear,&#8221; he
went on, smoothly. &#8220;Trevison wasn&#8217;t there. Miss
Benham went to the Diamond K.&#8221; His eyes gleamed
as Corrigan&#8217;s hands clenched. &#8220;Trevison rode back to
the car with her&mdash;which she had ordered taken to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
cut,&#8221; went on the banker. &#8220;And this morning about
ten o&#8217;clock Trevison came here with a led horse. He
and Miss Benham rode away together. I heard her
tell her aunt they were going to Blakeley&#8217;s ranch&mdash;it&#8217;s
about eight miles from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan&#8217;s face went white. &#8220;I&#8217;ll kill him for that!&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jealous, eh?&#8221; laughed the banker. &#8220;So, that&#8217;s
the reason&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan turned and struck bitterly. The banker&#8217;s
jaws clacked sharply&mdash;otherwise he fell silently, striking
his head against the edge of the step and rolling,
face down, into the dust.</p>
<p>When he recovered and sat up, Corrigan had gone.
The banker gazed foolishly around at a world that
was still reeling&mdash;felt his jaw carefully, wonder and
astonishment in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about that?&#8221; he asked of the
surrounding silence. &#8220;I&#8217;ve kidded him about women
before, and he never got sore. He must be in love!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Riding through a saccaton basin, the green-brown
tips so high that they caught at their stirrups as they
rode slowly along; a white, smiling sky above them and
Blakeley&#8217;s still three miles away, Miss Benham and
Trevison were chatting gayly at the instant the banker
had received Corrigan&#8217;s blow.</p>
<p>Miss Benham had spent the night thinking of Trevison,
and she had spent much of her time during the
present ride stealing glances at him. She had discovered
something about him that had eluded her the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
day before&mdash;an impulsive boyishness. It was hidden
behind the manhood of him, so that the casual observer
would not be likely to see it; men would have failed
to see it, because she was certain that with men he
would not let it be seen. But she knew the recklessness
that shone in his eyes, the energy that slumbered
in them ready to be applied any moment in response
to any whim that might seize him, were traits that
had not yet yielded to the stern governors of manhood&mdash;nor
would they yield in many years to come&mdash;they
were the fountains of virility that would keep him
young. She felt the irresistible appeal of him, responsive
to the youth that flourished in her own heart&mdash;and
Corrigan, older, more ponderous, less addicted
to impulse, grew distant in her thoughts and vision.
The day before yesterday her sympathies had been
with Corrigan&mdash;she had thought. But as she rode
she knew that they were threatening to desert him.
For this man of heroic mold who rode beside her was
disquietingly captivating in the bold recklessness of his
youth.</p>
<p>They climbed the far slope of the basin and halted
their horses on the crest. Before them stretched a
plain so big and vast and inviting that it made the
girl gasp with delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, awed; &#8220;isn&#8217;t it wonderful?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you&#8217;d like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The East has nothing like this,&#8221; she said, with a
broad sweep of the hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>She turned on him triumphantly. &#8220;There!&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
declared; &#8220;you have committed yourself. You are
from the East!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;ve never denied it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something vague and subtle had drawn them together
during the ride, bridging the hiatus of strangeness,
making them feel that they had been acquainted
long. It did not seem impertinent to her that she
should ask the question that she now put to him&mdash;she
felt that her interest in him permitted it:</p>
<p>&#8220;You are an easterner, and yet you have been out
here for about ten years. Your house is big and substantial,
but I should judge that it has no comforts,
no conveniences. You live there alone, except for
some men, and you have male servants&mdash;if you have
any. Why should you bury yourself here? You are
educated, you are young. There are great opportunities
for you in the East!&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused, for she saw a cynical expression in his
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; she said, impatiently, for she had been
very much in earnest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose I&#8217;ve got to tell you,&#8221; he said, soberly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what has come over me&mdash;you seem
to have me under a spell. I&#8217;ve never spoken about it
before. I don&#8217;t know why I should now. But you&#8217;ve
got to know, I presume.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On your head rest the blame,&#8221; he said, his grin
still cynical; &#8220;and upon mine the consequences. It
isn&#8217;t a pretty story to tell; it&#8217;s only virtue is its brevity.
I was fired out of college for fighting. The fellows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
I licked deserved what they got&mdash;and I deserved
what I got for breaking rules. I&#8217;ve always broken
rules. I may have broken laws&mdash;most of us have.
My father is wealthy. The last time I saw him he
said I was incorrigible and a dunce. I admit the former,
but I&#8217;m going to make him take the other back.
I told him so. He replied that he was from Missouri.
He gave me an opportunity to make good by cutting off
my allowance. There was a girl. When my allowance
was cut off she made me feel cold as an Eskimo.
Told me straight that she had never liked me in the
way she&#8217;d led me to believe she did, and that she
was engaged to a <i>real</i> man. She made the mistake of
telling me his name, and it happened to be one of the
fellows I&#8217;d had trouble with at college. The girl lost
her temper and told me things he&#8217;d said about me. I
left New York that night, but before I hopped on
the train I stopped in to see my rival and gave him the
bulliest trimming that I had ever given anybody. I
came out here and took up a quarter-section of land.
I bought more&mdash;after a while. I own five thousand
acres, and about a thousand acres of it is the best coal
land in the United States. I wouldn&#8217;t sell it for love
or money, for when your father gets his railroad running,
I&#8217;m going to cash in on ten of the leanest and
hardest and lonesomest years that any man ever put in.
I&#8217;m going back some day. But I won&#8217;t stay. I&#8217;ve lived
in this country so long that it&#8217;s got into my heart and
soul. It&#8217;s a golden paradise.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not share his enthusiasm&mdash;her thoughts
were selfishly personal, though they included him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And the girl!&#8221; she said. &#8220;When you go back,
would you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; he scoffed, vehemently. &#8220;That would
convince me that I am the dunce my father said I was!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl turned her head and smiled. And a little
later, when they were riding on again, she murmured
softly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ten years of lonesomeness and bitterness to save
his pride! I wonder if Hester Keyes knows what she
has missed?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>TWO LETTERS GO EAST</h3>
</div>

<p>After Agatha retired that night Rosalind sat for
a long time writing at a little desk in the private
car. She was tingling with excitement over a discovery
she had made, and was yearning for a confidante. Since
it had not been her habit to confide in Agatha, she did
the next best thing, which was to indite a letter to her
chum, Ruth Gresham. In one place she wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember Hester Keyes&#8217; love affair of
ten years ago? You certainly must remember it! If
you cannot, permit me to brush the dust of forgetfulness
away. You cannot forget the night you met William
Kinkaid? Of course you cannot forget that, for
when you are Mrs. Kinkaid&mdash;But there! I won&#8217;t
poke fun at you. But I think every married person
needs to treasure every shred of romance against inevitable
hum-drum days. Isn&#8217;t that a sad sentiment? But
I want to get ahead with my reminder.&#8221;</p>
<p>There followed much detail, having to do with Hester
Keyes&#8217; party, to which neither Rosalind nor Ruth
Gresham had been invited, for reasons which Rosalind
presently made obvious. She continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, custom does not permit girls of fourteen
to figure prominently at &#8216;coming-out&#8217; parties, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
after one is there and is relegated to a stair-landing,
one may use one&#8217;s eyes without restriction. Do you
remember my pointing out Hester Keyes&#8217; &#8216;fellow&#8217;?
But of course you didn&#8217;t pay much attention to him
after Billy Kinkaid sailed into your vision! But I
envied Hester Keyes her eighteen years&mdash;and Trevison
Brandon! He had the blackest eyes and hair!
And he simply adored Hester! It made me feel positively
savage when I heard shortly afterward that
she had thrown him over&mdash;after his father cut him
off&mdash;to take up with that fellow Harvey&mdash;I never
could remember his first name. And she married Harvey&mdash;and
regretted it, until Harvey died.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ruth, Trevison Brandon is out here. He calls
himself &#8216;Brand&#8217; Trevison. I met him two days ago,
and I did not recognize him, he has changed so much.
He puzzled me quite a little; but not even when I heard
his name did I connect him with the man I had seen
at Hester&#8217;s party. Ten years is <i>such</i> a long time, isn&#8217;t
it? And I never did have much of a memory for
names. But today he went with me to a certain ranch&mdash;Blakeley&#8217;s&mdash;which,
by the way, <i>father is going to
buy</i>&mdash;and on the way we became very much
acquainted, and he told me about his love affair. I
placed him instantly, then, and why I didn&#8217;t keel over
was, I suppose, because of the curious big saddles they
have out here, with enormous wooden <i>stirrups</i> on them.
I can hear you exclaim over that plural, but there are
no side-saddles. That is how it came that I was
unchaperoned&mdash;Agatha won&#8217;t take liberties with them,
the saddles. Thank Heaven!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>There followed much more, with only one further
reference to Trevison:</p>
<p>&#8220;He must be nearly thirty now, but he doesn&#8217;t look
it, he&#8217;s so boyish. I gather, though, that he is regarded
as a <i>man</i> out here, where, I understand, manhood is
measured by something besides mere appearances. He
owns acres and acres of land&mdash;some of it has coal on
it; and he is sure to be enormously wealthy, some day.
But I am twenty-four, myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The startling irrelevance of this sentence at first
surprised Ruth Gresham, and then caused her eyes to
brighten understandingly, as she read the letter a few
days later. She remarked, musingly:</p>
<p>&#8220;The inevitable hum-drum days, eh? And yet most
people long for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another letter was written when the one to Ruth
was completed. It was to J. Chalfant Benham.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Daddy</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;The West is a golden paradise. I could live here
many, many years. I visited Mr. Blakeley today. He
calls his ranch the Bar B. We wouldn&#8217;t have to change
the brand, would we? Trevison says the ranch is worth
all Blakeley asks for it. Mr. Blakeley says we can take
possession immediately, so I have decided to stay here.
Mrs. Blakeley has invited me, and I am going to have
my things taken over tomorrow. Since the Blakeley&#8217;s
are anxious to sell out and return South, don&#8217;t you
think you had better conclude the deal at once?</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style=' margin-right:4em;'>&#8220;Lovingly,</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Rosalind</span>.&#8221;</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE CHAOS OF CREATION</h3>
</div>

<p>The West saw many &#8220;boom&#8221; towns. They followed
in the wake of &#8220;gold strikes;&#8221; they grew,
mushroom-like, overnight&mdash;garish husks of squalor,
palpitating, hardy, a-tingle with extravagant hopes. A
few, it is true, lived to become substantial cities buzzing
with the American spirit, panting, fighting for progress
with an energy that shamed the Old World, lethargic
in its smug and self-sufficient superiority. But
many towns died in their gangling youth, tragic monuments
to hopes; but monuments also to effort, and to
the pioneer courage and the dreams of an empire-building
people.</p>
<p>Manti was destined to live. It was a boom town
with material reasons for substantial growth. Behind
it were the resources of a railroad company which
would anticipate the development of a section of country
bigger than a dozen Old-world states, and men
with brains keen enough to realize the commercial possibilities
it held. It had Corrigan for an advance agent&mdash;big,
confident, magnetic, energetic, suave, smooth.</p>
<p>Manti had awaited his coming; he was the magic
force, the fulfillment of the rumored promise. He had
stayed away for three weeks, following his departure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
on the special car after bringing Judge Lindman, and
when he stepped off the car again at the end of that
time Manti was &#8220;humming,&#8221; as he had predicted. During
the three weeks of his absence, the switch at Manti
had never been unoccupied. Trains had been coming in
regularly bearing merchandise, men, tools, machines,
supplies. Engineers had arrived; the basin near Manti,
choked by a narrow gorge at its westerly end (where
the dam was to be built) was dotted with tents, wagons,
digging implements, a miscellany of material whose
hauling had worn a rutted trail over the plains and
on the slope of the basin, continually active with wagon-train
and pack horse, and articulate with sweating,
cursing drivers.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a pippin!&#8221; gleefully confided a sleek-looking
individual who might have been mistaken for a western
&#8220;parson&#8221; had it not been for a certain sophisticated
cynicism that was prominent about him, and which
imparted a distasteful taint of his profession. &#8220;Give
me a year of this and I&#8217;ll open a joint in Frisco! I
cleaned out a brace of bull-whackers in the <i>Plaza</i> last
night&mdash;their first pay. Afterward I stung a couple of
cattlemen for a hundred each. Look at her hum!&#8221;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that it was midday, Manti was
teeming with life and action. Since the day that Miss
Benham had viewed the town from the window of the
private car, Manti had added more than a hundred
buildings to its total. They were not attractive; they
were ludicrous in their pitiful masquerade of substantial
types. Here and there a three-story structure reared
aloft, sheathed with galvanized iron, a garish aristocrat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
seemingly conscious of its superiority, brazen, in
its bid for attention; more modest buildings seemed
dwarfed, humiliated, squatting sullenly and enviously.
There were hotels, rooming-houses, boarding-houses,
stores, dwellings, saloons&mdash;and others which for many
reasons need not be mentioned. But they were pulsating
with life, electric, eager, expectant. Taking
advantage of the scarcity of buildings, an enterprising
citizen had erected tents in rows on the street line,
for whose shelter he charged enormously&mdash;and did
a capacity business.</p>
<p>&#8220;A hundred came in on the last train,&#8221; complained
the over-worked station agent. &#8220;God knows what
they all expect to do here!&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan had kept his promise to build Judge Lindman
a courthouse. It was a flat-roofed structure, one
story high, wedged between a saloon and Braman&#8217;s
bank building. A sign in the front window of Braman&#8217;s
bank announced that Jefferson Corrigan, agent
of the Land &amp; Improvement Company, of New York,
had office space within, but on the morning of the day
following his return to Manti, Corrigan was seated at
one side of a flat-top desk in the courthouse, talking
with Judge Lindman, who sat at the other side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got them all transcribed?&#8221; asked Corrigan.</p>
<p>The Judge drew a thin ledger from his desk and
passed it over to Corrigan. As Corrigan turned the
pages and his face lighted, the Judge&#8217;s grew correspondingly
troubled.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; exulted Corrigan. &#8220;This purports to
be an accurate and true record of all the land transactions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
in this section from the special grant to the
Midland Company, down to date. It shows no intermediate
owners from the Midland Company to the
present claimants. As a document arraigning carelessness
on the part of land buyers it cannot be excelled.
There isn&#8217;t a present owner that has a legal leg to
stand on!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is only one weak point in your case,&#8221; said
the Judge, and his eyes gleamed with satisfaction, which
he concealed by bowing his head. &#8220;It is that since
these records show no sale of its property by the Midland
Company, the Midland Company can come forward
and re-establish its title.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan laughed and flipped a legal-looking paper
in front of the Judge. The latter opened it and read,
showing eagerness. He laid it down after reading,
his hands trembling.</p>
<p>&#8220;It shows that the Midland Company&mdash;James Marchmont, president&mdash;transferred
to Jefferson Corrigan, on a date prior to these other transactions, one-hundred
thousand acres of land here&mdash;the Midland
Company&#8217;s entire holdings. Why, man, it is forgery!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Corrigan quietly. &#8220;James Marchmont
is alive. He signed his name right where it is. He&#8217;ll
confirm it, too, for he happens to be in something of
the fix that you are in. Therefore, there being no
records of any sales on your books&mdash;as revised, of
course&mdash;&#8221; he laughed; &#8220;Jeff Corrigan is the legal possessor
of one-hundred thousand acres of land right in
the heart of what is going to be the boom section of
the West!&#8221; He chuckled, lit a cigar, leaned back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
in his chair and looked at the Judge. &#8220;All you have
to do now is to enter that transaction on your records.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t expect the present owners to yield their
titles without a fight, do you?&#8221; asked the Judge. He
spoke breathlessly.</p>
<p>Corrigan grunted. &#8220;Sure; they&#8217;ll fight. But they&#8217;ll
lose. I&#8217;ve got them. I&#8217;ve got the power&mdash;the courts&mdash;the
law, behind me. I&#8217;ve got them, and I&#8217;ll squeeze
them. It means a mint of money, man. It will make
you. It&#8217;s the biggest thing that any man ever attempted
to pull off in this country!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s big,&#8221; groaned the Judge; &#8220;it&#8217;s stupendous!
It&#8217;s frightful! Why, man, if anything goes
wrong, it would mean&mdash;&#8221; He paused and shivered.</p>
<p>Corrigan smiled contemptuously. &#8220;Where&#8217;s the
original record?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I destroyed it,&#8221; said the Judge. He did not look
at Corrigan. &#8220;How?&#8221; demanded the latter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Burned it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221; Corrigan rubbed his palms together. &#8220;It&#8217;s
too soon to start anything. Things are booming, and
some of these owners will be trying to sell. Hold
them off&mdash;don&#8217;t record anything. Give them any
excuse that comes to your mind. Have you heard from
Washington?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The establishment of the court here has been confirmed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick work,&#8221; laughed Corrigan. He got up, murmuring
something about having to take care of some
leases. When he turned, it was to start and stand
rigid, his jaws set, his face pale. A man stood in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
open doorway&mdash;a man of about fifty apparently, furtive-eyed,
slightly shabby, though with an atmosphere
about him that hinted of past dignity of carriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim Marchmont!&#8221; said Corrigan. He stepped
forward, threateningly, his face dark with wrath. Without
speaking another word he seized the newcomer
by the coat collar, snapping his head back savagely,
and dragged him back of a wooden partition. Concealed
there from any of the curious in the street, he
jammed Marchmont against the wall of the building,
held him there with one hand and stuck a huge fist into
his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What in hell are you doing here?&#8221; he demanded.
&#8220;Come clean, or I&#8217;ll tear you apart!&#8221;</p>
<p>The other laughed, but there was no mirth in it,
and his thin lips were curved queerly, and were stiff
and white. &#8220;Don&#8217;t get excited, Jeff,&#8221; he said; &#8220;it
won&#8217;t be healthy.&#8221; And Corrigan felt something hard
and cold against his shirt front. He knew it was a
pistol and he released his hold and stepped back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking of coming clean,&#8221; said Marchmont.
&#8220;You crossed me. You told me you were going to
sell the Midland land to two big ranch-owners. I find
that you&#8217;re going to cut it up into lots and make big
money&mdash;loads of it. You handed me a measly thousand.
You stand to make millions. I want my divvy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got your nerve,&#8221; scoffed Corrigan. &#8220;You
got your bit when you sold the Midland before. You&#8217;re
a self-convicted crook, and if you make a peep out
here I&#8217;ll send you over the road for a thousand years!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another thousand now,&#8221; said Marchmont: &#8220;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
ten more when you commence to cash in. Otherwise,
a thousand years or not, I&#8217;ll start yapping here and
queer your game.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan&#8217;s lips were in an ugly pout. For an instant
it seemed he was going to defy his visitor. Then without
a word to him he stepped around the partition,
walked out the door and entered the bank. A few
minutes later he passed a bundle of greenbacks to
Marchmont and escorted him to the front door, where
he stood, watching, his face unpleasant, until Marchmont
vanished into one of the saloons.</p>
<p>&#8220;That settles <i>you</i>, you damned fool!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He stepped down into the street and went into the
bank. Braman fawned on him, smirking insincerely.
Corrigan had not apologized for striking the blow,
had never mentioned it, continuing his former attitude
toward the banker as though nothing had happened.
But Braman had not forgiven him. Corrigan wasted
no words:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s the best gun-man in this section?&#8221;</p>
<p>Braman studied a minute. &#8220;Clay Levins,&#8221; he said,
finally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you find him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s in town today; I saw him not more than
fifteen minutes ago, going into the <i>Elk</i>!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Find him and bring him here&mdash;by the back way,&#8221;
directed Corrigan.</p>
<p>Braman went out, wondering. A few minutes later
he returned, coming in at the front door, smiling with
triumph. Shortly afterward Corrigan was opening the
rear door on a tall, slender man of thirty-five, with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
thin face, a mouth that drooped at the corners, and
alert, furtive eyes. He wore a heavy pistol at his
right hip, low, the bottom of the holster tied to the
leather chaps, and as Corrigan closed the door he
noted that the man&#8217;s right hand lingered close to the
butt of the weapon.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Corrigan; &#8220;you&#8217;re perfectly
safe here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He talked in low tones to the man, so that Braman
could not hear. Levins departed shortly afterwards,
grinning crookedly, tucking a piece of paper into a
pocket, upon which Corrigan had transcribed something
that had been written on the cuff of his shirt sleeve.
Corrigan went to his desk and busied himself with some
papers. Over in the courthouse, Judge Lindman took
from a drawer in his desk a thin ledger&mdash;a duplicate
of the one he had shown Corrigan&mdash;and going to the
rear of the room opened the door of an iron safe and
stuck the ledger out of sight under a mass of legal
papers.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When Marchmont left Corrigan he went straight to
the <i>Plaza</i>, where he ordered a lunch and ate heartily.
After finishing his meal he emerged from the saloon
and stood near one of the front windows. One of the
hundred dollar bills that Corrigan had given him he
had &#8220;broke&#8221; in the <i>Plaza</i>, getting bills of small denomination
in change, and in his right trousers&#8217; pocket was
a roll that bulked comfortably in his hand. The feel
of it made him tingle with satisfaction, as, except for
the other thousand that Corrigan had given him some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
months ago, it was the only money he had had for a
long time. He knew he should take the next train out
of Manti; that he had done a hazardous thing in baiting
Corrigan, but he was lonesome and yearned for
the touch and voice of the crowds that thronged in
and out of the saloons and the stores, and presently he
joined them, wandering from saloon to saloon, drinking
occasionally, his content and satisfaction increasing
in proportion to the quantity of liquor he drank.</p>
<p>And then, at about three o&#8217;clock, in the barroom of
the <i>Plaza</i>, he heard a discordant voice at his elbow.
He saw men crowding, jostling one another to get
away from the spot where he stood&mdash;crouching, pale
of face, their eyes on him. It made him feel that he
was the center of interest, and he wheeled, staggering
a little&mdash;for he had drunk much more than he had
intended&mdash;to see what had happened. He saw Clay
Levins standing close to him, his thin lips in a cruel
curve, his eyes narrowed and glittering, his body in a
suggestive crouch. The silence that had suddenly
descended smote Marchmont&#8217;s ears like a momentary
deafness, and he looked foolishly around him, uncertain,
puzzled. Levins&#8217; voice shocked him, sobered him,
whitened his face:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fork over that coin you lifted from me in the <i>Elk</i>,
you light-fingered hound!&#8221; said Levins.</p>
<p>Marchmont divined the truth now. He made his
second mistake of the day. He allowed a flash of rage
to trick him into reaching for his pistol. He got it
into his hand and almost out of the pocket before
Levins&#8217; first bullet struck him, and before he could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
draw it entirely out the second savage bark of the gun
in Levins&#8217; hand shattered the stillness of the room.
Soundlessly, his face wreathed in a grin of hideous
satire, Marchmont sank to the floor and stretched
out on his back.</p>
<p>Before his body was still, Levins had drawn out the
bills that had reposed in his victim&#8217;s pocket. Crumpling
them in his hand he walked to the bar and tossed them
to the barkeeper.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at &#8217;em,&#8221; he directed. &#8220;I&#8217;m provin&#8217; they&#8217;re
mine. Good thing I got the numbers on &#8217;em.&#8221; While
the crowd jostled and crushed about him he read the
numbers from the paper Corrigan had given him, grinning
coldly as the barkeeper confirmed them. A deputy
sheriff elbowed his way through the press to Levins&#8217;
side, and the gun-man spoke to him, lightly: &#8220;I reckon
everybody saw him reach for his gun when I told him
to fork the coin over,&#8221; he said, indicating his victim.
&#8220;So you ain&#8217;t got nothin&#8217; on me. But if you&#8217;re figgerin&#8217;
that the coin ain&#8217;t mine, why I reckon a guy named
Corrigan will back up my play.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deputy took him at his word. They found Corrigan
at his desk in the bank building.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said when the deputy had told his story;
&#8220;I paid Levins the money this morning. Is it necessary
for you to know what for? No? Well, it seems
that the pickpocket got just what he deserved.&#8221; He
offered the deputy a cigar, and the latter went out,
satisfied.</p>
<p>Later, Corrigan looked appraisingly at Levins, who
still graced the office.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That was rather an easy job,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Marchmont
was slow with a gun. With a faster man&mdash;a
man, say&mdash;&#8221; he appeared to meditate &#8220;&mdash;like Trevison,
for instance. You&#8217;d have to be pretty careful&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trevison&#8217;s my friend,&#8221; grinned Levins coldly as
he got to his feet. &#8220;There&#8217;s nothin&#8217; doin&#8217; there&mdash;understand?
Get it out of your brain-box, for if anything
happens to &#8216;Firebrand,&#8217; I&#8217;ll perforate you sure
as hell!&#8221;</p>
<p>He stalked out of the office, leaving Corrigan looking
after him, frowningly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>STRAIGHT TALK</h3>
</div>

<p>Ten years of lonesomeness, of separation from all
the things he held dear, with nothing for his soul
to feed upon except the bitterness he got from a contemplation
of the past; with nothing but his pride and
his determination to keep him from becoming what he
had seen many men in this country become&mdash;dissolute
irresponsibles, drifting like ships without rudders&mdash;had
brought into Trevison&#8217;s heart a great longing. He
was like a man who for a long time has been deprived
of the solace of good tobacco, and&mdash;to use a simile
that he himself manufactured&mdash;he yearned to capture
someone from the East, sit beside him and fill his lungs,
his brain, his heart, his soul, with the breath, the aroma,
the spirit of the land of his youth. The appearance of
Miss Benham at Manti had thrilled him. For ten years
he had seen no eastern woman, and at sight of her
the old hunger of the soul became acute in him, aroused
in him a passionate worship that made his blood run
riot. It was the call of sex to sex, made doubly stirring
by the girl&#8217;s beauty, her breeziness, her virile,
alluring womanhood&mdash;by the appeal she made to the
love of the good and the true in his character. His
affection for Hester Keyes, he had long known, had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
been merely the vanity-tickling regard of the callow
youth&mdash;the sex attraction of adolescence, the &#8220;puppy&#8221;
love that smites all youth alike. For Rosalind Benham a
deeper note had been struck. Its force rocked him,
intoxicated him; his head rang with the music it made.</p>
<p>During the three weeks of her stay at Blakeley&#8217;s
they had been much together. Rosalind had accepted
his companionship as a matter of course. He had told
her many things about his past, and was telling her
many more things, as they sat today on an isolated
excrescence of sand and rock and bunch grass surrounded
by a sea of sage. From where they sat they
could see Manti&mdash;Manti, alive, athrob, its newly-come
hundreds busy as ants with their different pursuits.</p>
<p>The intoxication of the girl&#8217;s presence had never
been so great as it was today. A dozen times, drunken
with the nearness of her, with the delicate odor from
her hair, as a stray wisp fluttered into his face, he had
come very near to catching her in his arms. But he
had grimly mastered the feeling, telling himself that
he was not a savage, and that such an action would be
suicidal to his hopes. It cost him an effort, though, to
restrain himself, as his flushed face, his burning eyes
and his labored breath, told.</p>
<p>His broken wrist had healed. His hatred of Corrigan
had been kept alive by a recollection of the fight,
by a memory of the big man&#8217;s quickness to take advantage
of the banker&#8217;s foul trick, and by the passion for
revenge that had seized him, that held him in a burning
clutch. Jealousy of the big man he would not have
admitted; but something swelled his chest when he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
thought of Corrigan coming West in the same car with
the girl&mdash;a vague, gnawing something that made his
teeth clench and his facial muscles cord.</p>
<p>Rosalind had not told him that she had recognized
him, that during the ten years of his exile he had been
her ideal, but she could close her eyes at this minute
and imagine herself on the stair-landing at Hester
Keyes&#8217; party, could feel the identical wave of thrilling
admiration that had passed over her when her gaze
had first rested on him. Yes, it had survived, that girlhood
passion, but she had grown much older and experienced,
and she could not let him see what she felt.
But her curiosity was keener than ever; in no other
man of her acquaintance had she felt this intense
interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember you telling me the other day that your
men would have used their rifles, had the railroad company
attempted to set men to work in the cut. I presume
you must have given them orders to shoot. I
can&#8217;t understand you. You were raised in the East,
your parents are wealthy; it is presumed they gave you
advantages&mdash;in fact, you told me they had sent you
to college. You must have learned respect for the law
while there. And yet you would have had your men
resist forcibly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you before that I respected the law&mdash;so
long as the law is just and the fellow I&#8217;m fighting is
governed by it. But I refuse to fight under a rule
that binds one of my hands, while my opponent sails
into me with both hands free. I&#8217;ve never been a believer
in the doctrine of &#8216;turn the other cheek.&#8217; We are made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
with a capacity for feeling, and it boils, unrestrained,
in me. I never could play the hypocrite; I couldn&#8217;t
say &#8216;no&#8217; when I thought &#8216;yes&#8217; and make anybody believe
it. I couldn&#8217;t lie and evade and side-step, even to
keep from getting licked. I always told the truth and
expressed my feelings in language as straight, simple,
and direct as I could. It wasn&#8217;t always the discreet
way. Perhaps it wasn&#8217;t always the wise way. I won&#8217;t
argue that. But it was the only way I knew. It caused
me a lot of trouble&mdash;I was always in trouble. My
record in college would make a prize fighter turn green
with envy. I&#8217;m not proud of what I&#8217;ve made of my
life. But I haven&#8217;t changed. I do what my heart
prompts me to do, and I say what I think, regardless
of consequences.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be a very good method&mdash;if everybody
followed it,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;Unfortunately, it invites
enmity. Subtlety will take you farther in the world.&#8221;
She was smitten with an impulse, unwise, unconventional.
But the conventions! The East seemed effete
and far. Besides, she spoke lightly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us be perfectly frank, then. I think that perhaps
you take yourself too seriously. Life is a tragedy
to the tragic, a joke to the humorous, a drab canvas
to the unimaginative. It all depends upon what temperament
one sees it through. I dare say that I see
you differently than you see yourself. &#8217;O wad some
power the giftie gi&#8217;e us to see oursel&#8217;s as ithers see us&#8217;,&#8221;
she quoted, and laughed at the queer look in his eyes,
for his admiration for her had leaped like a living
thing at her bubbling spirits, and he was, figuratively,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
forced to place his heel upon it. &#8220;I confess it seems
to me that you take a too tragic view of things,&#8221; she
went on. &#8220;You are like D&#8217;Artagnan, always eager to
fly at somebody&#8217;s throat. Possibly, you don&#8217;t give other
people credit for unselfish motives; you are too suspicious;
and what you call plain talk may seem impertinence
to others&mdash;don&#8217;t you think? In any event,
people don&#8217;t like to hear the truth told about themselves&mdash;especially
by a big, earnest, sober-faced man who
seems to speak with conviction, and, perhaps, authority.
I think you look for trouble, instead of trying to
evade it. I think, too,&#8221; she said, looking straight at
him, &#8220;that you face the world in a too physical fashion;
that you place too much dependence upon brawn and
fire. That, following your own method of speaking
your mind, is what I think of you. I tremble to imagine
what you think of me for speaking so plainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed, his voice vibrating, and bold passion
gleamed in his eyes. He looked fairly at her, holding
her gaze, compelling it with the intensity of his own,
and she drew a deep, tremulous breath of understanding.
There followed a tense, breathless silence. And
then&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve brought it on yourself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I love
you. You are going to marry me&mdash;someday. That&#8217;s
what I think of you!&#8221;</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

&#8220;YOU ARE GOING TO MARRY ME&mdash;SOME DAY. THAT&#8217;S WHAT I THINK OF YOU!&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>She got to her feet, her cheeks flaming, confused,
half-frightened, though a fierce exultation surged within
her. She had half expected this, half dreaded it, and
now that it had burst upon her in such volcanic fashion
she realized that she had not been entirely prepared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
She sought refuge in banter, facing him, her cheeks
flushed, her eyes dancing.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Firebrand,&#8217;&#8221; she said. &#8220;The name fits you&mdash;Mr.
Carson was right. I warned you&mdash;if you remember&mdash;that
you placed too much dependence on brawn and
fire. You are making it very hard for me to see you
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had risen too, and stood before her, and he now
laughed frankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you I couldn&#8217;t play the hypocrite. I have
said what I think. I want you. But that doesn&#8217;t mean
that I am going to carry you away to the mountains.
I&#8217;ve got it off my mind, and I promise not to mention
it again&mdash;until you wish it. But don&#8217;t forget that some
day you are going to love me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How marvelous,&#8221; said she, tauntingly, though in
her confusion she could not meet his gaze, looking
downward. &#8220;How do you purpose to bring it about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By loving you so strongly that you can&#8217;t help yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With your confidence&mdash;&#8221; she began. But he interrupted,
laughing:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to forget it, now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
promised to show you that <i>Pueblo</i>, and we&#8217;ll have just
about time enough to make it and back to the Bar B
before dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>And they rode away presently, chatting on indifferent
subjects. And, keeping his promise, he said not
another word about his declaration. But the girl, stealing
glances at him, wondered much&mdash;and reached no
decision.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>When they reached the abandoned Indian village,
many of its houses still standing, he laughed. &#8220;That
would make a dandy fort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always thinking of fighting,&#8221; she mocked. But
her eyes flashed as she looked at him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE SPIRIT OF MANTI</h3>
</div>

<p>The Benham private car had clacked eastward
over the rails three weeks before, bearing with it
as a passenger only the negro autocrat. At the last moment,
discovering that she could not dissuade Rosalind
from her mad decision to stay at Blakeley&#8217;s ranch,
Agatha had accompanied her. The private car was now
returning, bearing the man who had poetically declared
to his fawning Board of Directors: &#8220;Our railroad is
the magic wand that will make the desert bloom like the
rose. We are embarked upon a project, gentlemen, so
big, so vast, that it makes even your president feel a
pulse of pride. This project is nothing more nor less
than the opening of a region of waste country which
an all-wise Creator has permitted to slumber for ages,
for no less purpose than to reserve it to the horny-handed
son of toil of our glorious country. It will
awaken to the clarion call of our wealth, our brains,
and our genius.&#8221; He then mentioned Corrigan and
the Midland grant&mdash;another reservation of Providence,
which a credulous and asinine Congress had
bestowed, in fee-simple, upon a certain suave gentleman,
named Marchmont&mdash;and disseminated such other
details as a servile board of directors need know; and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
then he concluded with a flowery peroration that left
his hearers smirking fatuously.</p>
<p>And today J. Chalfant Benham was come to look
upon the first fruits of his efforts.</p>
<p>As he stepped down from the private car he was
greeted by vociferous cheers from a jostling and enthusiastic
populace&mdash;for J. C. had very carefully wired
the time of his arrival and Corrigan had acted accordingly,
knowing J. C. well. J. C. was charmed&mdash;he
said so, later, in a speech from a flimsy, temporary
stand erected in the middle of the street in front of the
<i>Plaza</i>&mdash;and in saying so he merely told the truth. For,
next to money-making, adulation pleased him most. He
would have been an able man had he ignored the latter
passion. It seared his intellect as a pernicious habit
blasts the character. It sat on his shoulders&mdash;extravagantly
squared; it shone in his eyes&mdash;inviting inspection;
his lips, curved with smug complacence, betrayed
it as, sitting in Corrigan&#8217;s office after the conclusion
of the festivities, he smiled at the big man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Manti is a wonderful town&mdash;a <i>wonderful</i> town!&#8221;
he declared. &#8220;It may be said that success is lurking
just ahead. And much of the credit is due to your
efforts,&#8221; he added, generously.</p>
<p>Corrigan murmured a polite disclaimer, and plunged
into dry details. J. C. had a passion for dry details.
For many hours they sat in the office, their heads close
together. Braman was occasionally called in. Judge
Lindman was summoned after a time. J. C. shook the
Judge&#8217;s hand warmly and then resumed his chair, folding
his chubby hands over his corpulent stomach.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Judge Lindman,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you thoroughly understand
our position in this Midland affair.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge glanced at Corrigan. &#8220;Thoroughly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt there will be some contests. But the
present claimants have no legal status. Mr. &mdash; (here
J. C. mentioned a name that made the Judge&#8217;s eyes
brighten) tells me there will be no hitch. There could
not be, of course. In the absence of any court record
of possible transfers, the title to the land, of course,
reverts to the Midland Company. As Mr. Corrigan
has explained to me, he is entirely within his rights, having
secured the title to the land from Mr. Marchmont,
representing the Midland. You have no record of any
transfers from the Midland to the present claimants
or their predecessors, have you? There is no such
record?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge saw Corrigan&#8217;s amused grin, and surmised
that J. C. was merely playing with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, with some bitterness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then of course you are going to stand with Mr.
Corrigan against the present claimants?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I presume so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; said J. C. &#8220;If there is any doubt about it,
perhaps I had better remind you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge groaned in agony of spirit. &#8220;It won&#8217;t
be necessary to remind me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I thought. Well, gentlemen&mdash;&#8221; J. C. arose
&#8220;&mdash;that will be all for this evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus he dismissed the Judge, who went to his cot
behind a partition in the courthouse, while Corrigan
and J. C. stepped outside and walked slowly toward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
the private car. They lingered at the steps, and presently
J. C. called and a negro came out with two chairs.
J. C. and Corrigan draped themselves in the chairs
and smoked. Dusk was settling over Manti; lights
appeared in the windows of the buildings; a medley of
noises reached the ears of the two men. By day Manti
was lively enough, by night it was a maelstrom of
frenzied action. A hundred cow-ponies were hitched
to rails that skirted the street in front of store and
saloon; cowboys from ranches, distant and near, rollicked
from building to building, touching elbows with
men less picturesquely garbed; the strains of crude
music smote the flat, dead desert air; yells, shouts,
laughter filtered through the bedlam; an engine, attached
to a train of cars on the main track near the
private car, wheezed steam in preparation for its eastward
trip, soon to begin.</p>
<p>Benham had solemn thoughts, sitting there, watching.</p>
<p>&#8220;That crowd wouldn&#8217;t have much respect for law.
They&#8217;re living at such a pitch that they&#8217;d lose their
senses entirely if any sudden crisis should arise. I&#8217;d
feel my way carefully, Corrigan&mdash;if I were you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan laughed deeply. &#8220;Don&#8217;t lose any sleep over
it. There are fifty deputy marshals in that crowd&mdash;and
they&#8217;re heeled. The rear room in the bank building
is a young arsenal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Benham started. &#8220;How on earth&mdash;&#8221; he began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Law and order,&#8221; smiled Corrigan. &#8220;A telegram
did it. The territory wants a reputation for safety.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; said Benham, after a silence; &#8220;I <i>had</i>
to take that Trevison affair out of your hands. We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
don&#8217;t want to antagonize the man. He will be valuable
to us&mdash;later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Carrington, the engineer I sent out here to look
over the country before we started work, did considerable
nosing around Trevison&#8217;s land while in the vicinity.
He told me there were unmistakable signs of coal of a
good quality and enormous quantity. We ought to be
able to drive a good bargain with Trevison one of
these days&mdash;if we handle him carefully.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan frowned and grunted. &#8220;His land is included
in that of the Midland grant. He shall be
treated like the others. If that is your only objection&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Benham. &#8220;I have discovered that
&#8216;Brand&#8217; Trevison is really Trevison Brandon, the disgraced
son of Orrin Brandon, the millionaire.&#8221;</p>
<p>The darkness hid Corrigan&#8217;s ugly pout. &#8220;How did
you discover that?&#8221; he said, coolly, after a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;My daughter mentioned it in one of her letters to
me. I confirmed, by quizzing Brandon, senior. Brandon
is powerful and obstinate. If he should discover
what our game is he would fight us to the last ditch.
The whole thing would go to smash, perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t tell him about his son being out here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That it&#8217;s my land; that I&#8217;m going to take it away
from Trevison, father or no father. I&#8217;m going to
break him. That&#8217;s what I mean!&#8221; Corrigan&#8217;s big
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
hands were clenched on the arms of his chair; his eyes
gleamed balefully in the semi-darkness. J. C. felt a
tremor of awed admiration for him. He laughed, nervously.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;if you think you can handle
it&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>They sat there for a long time, smoking in silence.
One thought dominated Corrigan&#8217;s mind: &#8220;Three
weeks, and exchanging confidences&mdash;damn him!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>A discordant note floated out of the medley of sound
in palpitating Manti, sailed over the ridiculous sky line
and smote the ears of the two on the platform. The
air rocked an instant later with a cheer, loud, pregnant
with enthusiasm. And then a mass of men, close-packed,
undulating, moved down the street toward the
private car.</p>
<p>Benham&#8217;s face whitened and he rose from his chair.
&#8220;Good God!&#8221; he said; &#8220;what&#8217;s happened?&#8221; He felt
Corrigan&#8217;s hand on his shoulder, forcing him back into
his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t concern us,&#8221; said the big man; &#8220;wait; we&#8217;ll
know pretty soon. Something&#8217;s broke loose.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men watched&mdash;Benham breathless, wide-eyed;
Corrigan with close-set lips and out-thrust chin.
The mass moved fast. It passed the <i>Plaza</i>, far up the
street, receiving additions each second as men burst
out of doors and dove to the fringe; and grew in
front as other men skittered into it, hanging to its edge
and adding to the confusion. But Corrigan noted that
the mass had a point, like a wedge, made by three men
who seemed to lead it. Something familiar in the stature
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
and carriage of one of the men struck Corrigan,
and he strained his eyes into the darkness the better
to see. He could be sure of the identity of the man,
presently, and he set his jaws tighter and continued
to watch, with bitter malignance in his gaze, for the
man was Trevison. There was no mistaking the broad
shoulders, the set of the head, the big, bold and confident
poise of the man. At the point of the wedge he
looked what he was&mdash;the leader; he dominated the
crowd; it became plain to Corrigan as the mass moved
closer that he was intent on something that had aroused
the enthusiasm of his followers, for there were shouts
of: &#8220;That&#8217;s the stuff! Give it to them! Run &#8217;em out!&#8221;</p>
<p>For an instant as the crowd passed the <i>Elk</i> saloon,
its lights revealing faces in its glare, Corrigan thought
its destination was the private car, and his hand went
to his hip. It was withdrawn an instant later, though,
when the leader swerved and marched toward the train
on the main track. In the light also, Corrigan saw
something that gave him a hint of the significance of it
all. His laugh broke the tension of the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Denver Ed and Poker Charley,&#8221; he said to
Benham. &#8220;It&#8217;s likely they&#8217;ve been caught cheating and
have been invited to make themselves scarce.&#8221; And he
laughed again, with slight contempt, at Benham&#8217;s sigh
of relief.</p>
<p>The mass surged around the rear coach of the train.
There was some laughter, mingled with jeers, and while
this was at its height a man broke from the mass and
walked rapidly toward Corrigan and Benham. It was
Braman. Corrigan questioned him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s two professional gamblers. They&#8217;ve been
fleecing Manti&#8217;s easy marks with great facility. Tonight
they had Clay Levins in the back room of the <i>Belmont</i>.
He had about a thousand dollars (the banker looked
at Corrigan and closed an eye), and they took it away
from him. It looked square, and Levins didn&#8217;t kick.
Couldn&#8217;t anyway&mdash;he&#8217;s lying in the back room of the
<i>Belmont</i> now, paralyzed. I think that somebody told
Levins&#8217; wife about him shooting Marchmont yesterday,
and Mrs. Levins likely sent Trevison after hubby&mdash;knowing
hubby&#8217;s appetite for booze. Levins isn&#8217;t
giving the woman a square deal, so far as that is concerned,&#8221;
went on the banker; &#8220;she and the kids are in
want half the time, and I&#8217;ve heard that Trevison&#8217;s
helped them out on quite a good many occasions. Anyway,
Trevison appeared in town this afternoon, looking
for Levins. Before he found him he heard these
two beauties framing up on him. That&#8217;s the result&mdash;the
two beauties go out. The crowd was for stringing
them up, but Trevison wouldn&#8217;t have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Marchmont?&#8221; interrupted Benham. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t possible&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; grinned Corrigan. &#8220;Yes, sir, the former
president of the Midland Company was shot to
death yesterday for pocket-picking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord!&#8221; said Benham.</p>
<p>&#8220;So Levins&#8217; wife sent Trevison for hubby,&#8221; said
Corrigan, quietly. &#8220;She&#8217;s <i>that</i> thick with Trevison, is
she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get that out of your mind, Jeff,&#8221; returned the
banker, noting Corrigan&#8217;s tone. &#8220;Everybody that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
knows of the case will tell you that everything&#8217;s straight
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Corrigan laughed, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The train steamed away as they talked, and the crowd
began to break up and scatter toward the saloons.
Before that happened, however, there was a great jam
around Trevison; he was shaking hands right and left.
Voices shouted that he was &#8220;all there!&#8221; As he started
away he was forced to shove his way through the press
around him.</p>
<p>Benham had been watching closely this evidence of
Trevison&#8217;s popularity; he linked it with some words that
his daughter had written to him regarding the man,
and as a thought formed in his mind he spoke it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d reconsider about hooking up with that man
Trevison, Corrigan. He&#8217;s one of those fellows that
win popularity easily, and it won&#8217;t do you any good to
antagonize him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; laughed Corrigan, coldly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>FOR THE &#8220;KIDDIES&#8221;</h3>
</div>

<p>Trevison dropped from Nigger at the dooryard
of Levins&#8217; cabin, and looked with a grim smile at
Levins himself lying face downward across the saddle
on his own pony. He had carried Levins out of the
<i>Belmont</i> and had thrown him, as he would have thrown
a sack of meal, across the saddle, where he had lain
during the four-mile ride, except during two short intervals
in which Trevison had lifted him off and laid him
flat on the ground, to rest. Trevison had meditated,
not without a certain wry humor, upon the strength and
the protracted potency of Manti&#8217;s whiskey, for not once
during his home-coming had Levins shown the slightest
sign of returning consciousness. He was as slack
as a meal sack now, as Trevison lifted him from the
pony&#8217;s back and let him slip gently to the ground at his
feet. A few minutes later, Trevison was standing in
the doorway of the cabin, his burden over his shoulder,
the weak glare of light from within the cabin stabbing
the blackness of the night and revealing him to the
white-faced woman who had answered his summons.</p>
<p>Her astonishment had been of the mute, agonized
kind; her eyes, hollow, eloquent with unspoken misery
and resignation, would have told Trevison that this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
was not the first time, had he not known from personal
observation. She stood watching, gulping, shame and
mortification bringing patches of color into her cheeks,
as Trevison carried Levins into a bedroom and laid
him down, removing his boots. She was standing near
the door when Trevison came out of the bedroom; she
was facing the blackness of the desert night&mdash;a blacker
future, unknowingly&mdash;and Trevison halted on the
threshold of the bedroom door and set his teeth in sympathy.
For the woman deserved better treatment. He
had known her for several years&mdash;since the time when
Levins, working for him, had brought her from a ranch
on the other side of the Divide, announcing their marriage.
It had been a different Levins, then, as it was a
different wife who stood at the door now. She had
faded; the inevitable metamorphosis wrought by neglect,
worry and want, had left its husks&mdash;a wan, tired-looking
woman of thirty who had only her hopes to
nourish her soul. There were children, too&mdash;if that
were any consolation. Trevison saw them as he glanced
around the cabin. They were in another bed; through
an archway he could see their chubby faces. His lungs
filled and his lips straightened.</p>
<p>But he grinned presently, in an effort to bring cheer
into the cabin, reaching into a pocket and bringing out
the money he had recovered for Levins.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are nearly a thousand dollars here. Two
tin-horn gamblers tried to take it from Clay, but I
headed them off. Tell Clay&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Levins&#8217; face whitened; it was more money than
she had ever seen at one time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Clay&#8217;s?&#8221; she interrupted, perplexedly. &#8220;Why,
where&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the slightest idea&mdash;but he had it, they
tried to take it away from him&mdash;it&#8217;s here now&mdash;it
belongs to you.&#8221; He shoved it into her hands and
stepped back, smiling at the stark wonder and joy in
her eyes. He saw the joy vanish&mdash;concern and haunting
worry came into her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;They told me that Clay shot&mdash;killed&mdash;a man yesterday.
Is it true?&#8221; She cast a fearing look at the
bed where the children lay.</p>
<p>&#8220;The damned fools!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s true!&#8221; She covered her face with her
hands, the money in them. Then she took the hands
away and looked at the money in them, loathingly. &#8220;Do
you think Clay&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; he said shortly, anticipating. &#8220;That couldn&#8217;t
be. For the man Clay killed had this money on him.
Clay accused him of picking his pocket. Clay gave
the bartender in the <i>Plaza</i> the number of each bill
before he saw them after taking the bills out of the
pickpocket&#8217;s clothing. So it can&#8217;t be as you feared.&#8221;</p>
<p>She murmured incoherently and pressed both hands
to her breast. He laughed and walked to the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you need it, you and the kiddies. I&#8217;m glad
to have been of some service to you. Tell Clay he
owes me something for cartage. If there is anything
I can do for you and Clay and the kiddies I&#8217;d be only
too glad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&mdash;now,&#8221; said the woman, gratitude shining
from her eyes, mingling with a worried gleam.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she added, passionately; &#8220;if Clay was only different!
Can&#8217;t you help him to be strong, Mr. Trevison?
Like you? Can&#8217;t you be with him more, to try
to keep him straight for the sake of the children?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clay&#8217;s odd, lately,&#8221; Trevison frowned. &#8220;He seems
to have changed a lot. I&#8217;ll do what I can, of course.&#8221;
He stepped out of the door and then looked back,
calling: &#8220;I&#8217;ll put Clay&#8217;s pony away. Good night.&#8221;
And the darkness closed around him.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Over at Blakeley&#8217;s ranch, J. C. Benham had just
finished an inspection of the interior and had sank into
the depths of a comfortable chair facing his daughter.
Blakeley and his wife had retired, the deal that
would place the ranch in possession of Benham having
been closed. J. C. gazed critically at his daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like it here, eh?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, you look it.&#8221;
He shook a finger at her. &#8220;Agatha has been writing
to me rather often, lately,&#8221; he added. There followed
no answer and J. C. went on, narrowing his eyes at
the girl. &#8220;She tells me that this fellow who calls himself
&#8216;Brand&#8217; Trevison has proven himself a&mdash;shall we
say, persistent?&mdash;escort on your trips of inspection
around the ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosalind&#8217;s face slowly crimsoned.</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; said Benham.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought Corrigan&mdash;&#8221; he began. The girl&#8217;s eyes
chilled.</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; said Benham, again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>EXPOSED TO THE SUNLIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a month before Trevison went to town,
again. Only once during that time did he see Rosalind
Benham, for the Blakeleys had vacated, and goods
and servants had arrived from the East and needed attention.
Rosalind presided at the Bar B ranchhouse, under
Agatha&#8217;s chaperonage, and she had invited Trevison
to visit her whenever the mood struck him. He had
been in the mood many times, but had found no opportunity,
for the various activities of range work claimed
his attention. After a critical survey of Manti and
vicinity, J. C. had climbed aboard his private car to
be whisked to New York, where he reported to his
Board of Directors that Manti would one day be one
of the greatest commercial centers of the West.</p>
<p>Vague rumors of a legal tangle involving the land
around Manti had reached Trevison&#8217;s ears, and this
morning he had jumped on Nigger, determined to run
the rumors down. He made a wide swing, following
the river, which took him miles from his own property
and into the enormous basin which one day the engineers
expected to convert into a mammoth lake from
which the thirst of many dry acres of land was to be
slaked; and halting Nigger near the mouth of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
gorge, watched the many laborers, directed by various
grades of bosses, at work building the foundation of
the dam. Later, he crossed the basin, followed the
well-beaten trail up the slope to the level, and shortly
he was in Hanrahan&#8217;s saloon across the street from
Braman&#8217;s bank, listening to the plaint of Jim Lefingwell,
the Circle Cross owner, whose ranch was east of
town. Lefingwell was big, florid, and afflicted with perturbation
that was almost painful. So exercised was he
that he was at times almost incoherent.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s boomin&#8217;, ain&#8217;t she? Meanin&#8217; this man&#8217;s town,
of course. An&#8217; a man&#8217;s got a right to cash in on a
boom whenever he gits the chance. Well, I&#8217;d figgered
to cash in. I ain&#8217;t no hawg an&#8217; I got savvy enough to
perceive without the aid of any damn fortune-teller
that cattle is done in this country&mdash;considered as the
main question. I&#8217;ve got a thousand acres of land&mdash;which
I paid for in spot cash to Dick Kessler about
eight years ago. If Dick was here he&#8217;d back me up in
that. But he ain&#8217;t here&mdash;the doggone fool went an&#8217;
died about four years ago, leavin&#8217; me unprotected. Well,
now, not digressin&#8217; any, I gits the idea that I&#8217;m goin&#8217;
to unload consid&#8217;able of my thousand acres on the sufferin&#8217;
fools that&#8217;s yearnin&#8217; to come into this country an&#8217;
work their heads off raisin&#8217; alfalfa an&#8217; hawgs, an&#8217; cabbages
an&#8217; sons with Pick-a-dilly collars to be eddicated
East an&#8217; come back home some day an&#8217; lift the mortgage
from the old homestead&mdash;which job they always
falls down on&mdash;findin&#8217; it more to their likin&#8217; to mortgage
their souls to buy jew&#8217;l&#8217;ry for fast wimmin. Well,
not digressin&#8217; any, I run a-foul of a guy last week which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
was dead set on investin&#8217; in ten acres of my land,
skirtin&#8217; one of the irrigation ditches which they&#8217;re figgerin&#8217;
on puttin&#8217; in. The price I wanted was a heap
satisfyin&#8217; to the guy. But he suggests that before he
forks over the coin we go down to the courthouse an&#8217;
muss up the records to see if my title is clear. Well,
not digressin&#8217; any, she ain&#8217;t! She ain&#8217;t even nowheres
clear a-tall&mdash;she ain&#8217;t even there! She&#8217;s wiped off,
slick an&#8217; clean! There ain&#8217;t a damned line to show
that I ever bought my land from Dick Kessler, an&#8217; there
ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217; on no record to show that Dick Kessler
ever owned it! What in hell do you think of that?</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, not digressin&#8217; any,&#8221; he went on as Trevison
essayed to speak; &#8220;that ain&#8217;t the worst of it. While
I was in there, talkin&#8217; to Judge Lindman, this here big
guy that you fit with&mdash;Corrigan&mdash;comes in. I gathers
from the trend of his remarks that I never had a legal
title to my land&mdash;that it belongs to the guy which
bought it from the Midland Company&mdash;which is him.
Now what in hell do you think of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew Dick Kessler,&#8221; said Trevison, soberly. &#8220;He
was honest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Square as a dollar!&#8221; violently affirmed Lefingwell.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; sympathized Trevison. &#8220;That
places you in a mighty bad fix. If there&#8217;s anything I
can do for you, why&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. &#8216;Brand&#8217; Trevison?&#8221; said a voice at Trevison&#8217;s
elbow. Trevison turned, to see a short, heavily built
man smiling mildly at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a deputy from Judge Lindman&#8217;s court,&#8221; announced
the man. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a summons for you. Saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
you coming in here&mdash;saves me a trip to your place.&#8221;
He shoved a paper into Trevison&#8217;s hands, grinned, and
went out. For an instant Trevison stood, looking after
the man, wondering how, since the man was a stranger
to him, he had recognized him&mdash;and then he opened
the paper to discover that he was ordered to appear
before Judge Lindman the following day to show cause
why he should not be evicted from certain described
property held unlawfully by him. The name, Jefferson
Corrigan, appeared as plaintiff in the action.</p>
<p>Lefingwell was watching Trevison&#8217;s face closely, and
when he saw it whiten, he muttered, understandingly:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got it, too, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Trevison shoved the paper into a pocket.
&#8220;Looks like you&#8217;re not going to be skinned alone, Lefingwell.
Well, so-long; I&#8217;ll see you later.&#8221;</p>
<p>He strode out, leaving Lefingwell slightly stunned
over his abrupt leave-taking. A minute later he was
in the squatty frame courthouse, towering above Judge
Lindman, who had been seated at his desk and who
had risen at his entrance.</p>
<p>Trevison shoved the summons under Lindman&#8217;s nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just got this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What does it mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is perfectly understandable,&#8221; the Judge smiled
with forced affability. &#8220;The plaintiff, Mr. Jefferson
Corrigan, is a claimant to the title of the land now
held by you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Corrigan can have no claim on my land; I bought
it five years ago from old Buck Peters. He got it from
a man named Taylor. Corrigan is bluffing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge coughed and dropped his gaze from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
belligerent eyes of the young man. &#8220;That will be determined
in court,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The entire land transactions
in this county, covering a period of twenty-five
years, are recorded in that book.&#8221; And the Judge indicated
a ledger on his desk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take a look at it.&#8221; Trevison reached for the
ledger, seized it, the Judge protesting, half-heartedly,
though with the judicial dignity that had become habitual
from long service in his profession.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a high-handed proceeding, young man. You
are in contempt of court!&#8221; The Judge tried, but could
not make his voice ring sincerely. It seemed to him
that this vigorous, clear-eyed young man could see the
guilt that he was trying to hide.</p>
<p>Trevison laughed grimly, holding the Judge off with
one hand while he searched the pages of the book,
leaning over the desk. He presently closed the book
with a bang and faced the Judge, breathing heavily,
his muscles rigid, his eyes cold and glittering.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s trickery here!&#8221; He took the ledger up
and slammed it down on the desk again, his voice vibrating.
&#8220;Judge Lindman, this isn&#8217;t a true record&mdash;it is
not the original record! I saw the original record five
years ago, when I went personally to Dry Bottom
with Buck Peters to have my deed recorded! This
record is a fake&mdash;it has been substituted for the original!
I demand that you stay proceedings in this matter
until a search can be made for the original record!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the original record.&#8221; Again the Judge tried
to make his voice ring sincerely, and again he failed.
His one mistake had not hardened him and judicial dignity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
could not help him to conceal his guilty knowledge.
He winced as he felt Trevison&#8217;s burning gaze on him,
and could not meet the young man&#8217;s eyes, boring like
metal points into his consciousness. Trevison sprang
forward and seized him by the shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;By God&mdash;you know it isn&#8217;t the original!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge succeeded in meeting Trevison&#8217;s eyes,
but his age, his vacillating will, his guilt, could not
combat the overpowering force and virility of this volcanic
youth, and his gaze shifted and fell.</p>
<p>He heard Trevison catch his breath&mdash;shrilling it
into his lungs in one great sob&mdash;and then he stood,
white and shaking, beside the desk, looking at Trevison
as the young man went out of the door&mdash;a laugh
on his lips, mirthless, bitter, portending trouble and
violence.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Corrigan was sitting at his desk in the bank building
when Trevison entered the front door. The big man
seemed to have been expecting his visitor, for just
before the latter appeared at the door Corrigan took
a pistol from a pocket and laid it on the desk beside
him, placing a sheet of paper over it. He swung slowly
around and faced Trevison, cold interest in his gaze.
He nodded shortly as Trevison&#8217;s eyes met his.</p>
<p>In a dozen long strides Trevison was at his side.
The young man was pale, his lips were set, he was
breathing fast, his nostrils were dilated&mdash;he was at
that pitch of excitement in which a word, a look or a
movement brings on action, instantaneous, unrecking of
consequences. But he exercised repression that made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
the atmosphere of the room tingle with tension of the
sort that precedes the clash of mighty forces&mdash;he
deliberately sat on one corner of Corrigan&#8217;s desk, one
leg dangling, the other resting on the floor, one hand
resting on the idle leg, his body bent, his shoulders
drooping a little forward. His voice was dry and
light&mdash;Patrick Carson would have said his grin was
tiger-like.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s the kind of a whelp you are!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Corrigan caught his breath; his hands clenched, his
face reddened darkly. He shot a quick glance at the
sheet of paper under which he had placed the pistol.
Trevison interpreted it, brushed the paper aside, disclosing
the weapon. His lips curled; he took the
pistol, &#8220;broke&#8221; it, tossed cartridges and weapon into
a corner of the desk and laughed lowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you were expecting me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m
here. You want my land, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want the land that I&#8217;m entitled to under the terms
of my purchase&mdash;the original Midland grant, consisting
of one-hundred thousand acres. It belongs to me,
and I mean to have it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a liar, Corrigan,&#8221; said the young man, holding
the other&#8217;s gaze coldly; &#8220;you&#8217;re a lying, sneaking
crook. You have no claim to the land, and you know
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan smiled stiffly. &#8220;The record of the deal I
made with Jim Marchmont years before any of you
people usurped the property is in my pocket at this
minute. The court, here, will uphold it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevison narrowed his eyes at the big man and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
laughed, bitter humor in the sound. It was as though
he had laughed to keep his rage from leaping, naked
and murderous, into this discussion.</p>
<p>&#8220;It takes nerve, Corrigan, to do what you are
attempting; it does, by Heaven&mdash;sheer, brazen gall!
It&#8217;s been done, though, by little, pettifogging shysters,
by piking real-estate crooks&mdash;thousands of parcels of
property scattered all over the United States have been
filched in that manner. But a hundred-thousand acres!
It&#8217;s the biggest steal that ever has been attempted, to
my knowledge, short of a Government grab, and your
imagination does you credit. It&#8217;s easy to see what&#8217;s
been done. You&#8217;ve got a fake title from Marchmont,
antedating ours; you&#8217;ve got a crooked judge here, to
befuddle the thing with legal technicalities; you&#8217;ve got
the money, the power, the greed, and the cold-blooded
determination. But I don&#8217;t think you understand what
you&#8217;re up against&mdash;do you? Nearly every man who
owns this land that you want has worked hard for it.
It&#8217;s been bought with work, man&mdash;work and lonesomeness
and blood&mdash;and souls. And now you want to
sweep it all away with one stroke. You want to step
in here and reap the benefit; you want to send us out
of here, beggars.&#8221; His voice leaped from its repression;
it now betrayed the passion that was consuming
him; it came through his teeth: &#8220;You can&#8217;t hand me
that sort of a raw deal, Corrigan, and make me like
it. Understand that, right now. You&#8217;re bucking the
wrong man. You can drag the courts into it; you can
wriggle around a thousand legal corners, but damn you,
you can&#8217;t avert what&#8217;s bound to come if you don&#8217;t lay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
off this deal, and that&#8217;s a fight!&#8221; He laughed, full-throated,
his voice vibrating from the strength of the
passion that blazed in his eyes. He revealed, for an
instant to Corrigan the wild, reckless untamed youth
that knew no law save his own impulses, and the big
man&#8217;s eyes widened with the revelation, though he gave
no other sign. He leaned back in his chair, smiling
coldly, idly flecking a bit of ash from his shirt where
it had fallen from his cigar.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am prepared for a fight. You&#8217;ll get plenty of
it before you&#8217;re through&mdash;if you don&#8217;t lie down and
be good.&#8221; There was malice in his look, complacent
consciousness of his power. More, there was an impulse
to reveal to this young man whom he intended
to ruin, at least one of the motives that was driving
him. He yielded to the impulse.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell you something. I think I would
have let you out of this deal, if you hadn&#8217;t been so
fresh. But you made a grand-stand play before the
girl I am going to marry. You showed off your horse
to make a bid for her favor. You paraded before her
window in the car to attract her attention. I saw you.
You rode me down. You&#8217;ll get no mercy. I&#8217;m going
to break you. I&#8217;m going to send you back to your
father, Brandon, senior, in worse condition than when
you left, ten years ago.&#8221; He sneered as Trevison
started and stepped on the floor, rigid.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you recognize me?&#8221; Curiosity had dulled
the young man&#8217;s passion; his tone was hoarse.</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; Corrigan laughed, mockingly. &#8220;Did you
think you could repose any confidence in a woman you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
have known only about a month? Did you think she
wouldn&#8217;t tell me&mdash;her promised husband? She has
told me&mdash;everything that she succeeded in getting out
of you. She is heart and soul with me in this deal. She
is ambitious. Do you think she would hesitate to sacrifice
a clod-hopper like you? She&#8217;s very clever, Trevison;
she&#8217;s deep, and more than a match for you in
wits. Fight, if you like, you&#8217;ll get no sympathy there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevison&#8217;s faith in Miss Benham had received a
shock; Corrigan&#8217;s words had not killed it, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a liar!&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Corrigan flushed, but smiled icily. &#8220;How many people
know that you have coal on your land, Trevison?&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw Trevison&#8217;s hands clench, and he laughed in
grim amusement. It pleased him to see his enemy
writhe and squirm before him; the grimness came
because of a mental picture, in his mind at this minute,
of Trevison confiding in the girl. He looked up,
the smile freezing on his lips, for within a foot of his
chest was the muzzle of Trevison&#8217;s pistol. He saw
the trigger finger contracting; saw Trevison&#8217;s free hand
clenched, the muscles corded and knotted&mdash;he felt the
breathless, strained, unreal calm that precedes tragedy,
grim and swift. He slowly stiffened, but did not shrink
an inch. It took him seconds to raise his gaze to Trevison&#8217;s
face, and then he caught his breath quickly and
smiled with straight lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; you won&#8217;t do it, Trevison,&#8221; he said, slowly;
&#8220;you&#8217;re not that kind.&#8221; He deliberately swung around
in the chair and drew another cigar from a box on the
desk top, lit it and leaned back, again facing the pistol.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>Trevison restored the pistol to the holster, brushing
a hand uncertainly over his eyes as though to clear his
mental vision, for the shock that had come with the
revelation of Miss Benham&#8217;s duplicity had made his
brain reel with a lust to kill. He laughed hollowly.
His voice came cold and hard:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right&mdash;it wouldn&#8217;t do. It would be plain
murder, and I&#8217;m not quite up to that. You know your
men, don&#8217;t you&mdash;you coyote&#8217;s whelp! You know I&#8217;ll
fight fair. You&#8217;ll do yours underhandedly. Get up!
There&#8217;s your gun! Load it! Let&#8217;s see if you&#8217;ve got
the nerve to face a gun, with one in your own hand!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my fighting in my own way.&#8221; Corrigan&#8217;s
eyes kindled, but he did not move. Trevison made a
gesture of contempt, and wheeled, to go. As he turned
he caught a glimpse of a hand holding a pistol, as it
vanished into a narrow crevice between a jamb and
the door that led to the rear room. He drew his own
weapon with a single movement, and swung around to
Corrigan, his muscles tensed, his eyes alert and chill
with menace.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bore you if you wink an eyelash!&#8221; he warned,
in a whisper.</p>
<p>He leaped, with the words, to the door, lunging
against it, sending it crashing back so that it smashed
against the wall, overbalancing some boxes that reposed
on a shelf and sending them clattering. He stood in
the opening, braced for another leap, tall, big, his muscles
swelling and rippling, recklessly eager. Against
the partition, which was still swaying, his arms outstretched,
a pistol in one hand, trying to crowd still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
farther back to escape the searching glance of Trevison&#8217;s
eyes, was Braman.</p>
<p>He had overheard Trevison&#8217;s tense whisper to Corrigan.
The cold savagery in it had paralyzed him, and
he gasped as Trevison&#8217;s eyes found him, and the pistol
that he tried to raise dangled futilely from his nerveless
fingers. It thudded heavily upon the boards of
the floor an instant later, a shriek of fear mingling
with the sound as he went down in a heap from a vicious,
deadening blow from Trevison&#8217;s fist.</p>
<p>Trevison&#8217;s leap upon Braman had been swift; he was
back in the doorway instantly, looking at Corrigan, his
eyes ablaze with rage, wild, reckless, bitter. He
laughed&mdash;the sound of it brought a grayish pallor to
Corrigan&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;That explains your nerve!&#8221; he taunted. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
frame-up. You sent the deputy after me&mdash;pointed me
out when I went into Hanrahan&#8217;s! That&#8217;s how he knew
me! You knew I&#8217;d come in here to have it out with
you, and you figured to have Braman shoot me when
my back was turned! Ha, ha!&#8221; He swung his pistol
on Corrigan; the big man gripped the arms of his chair
and sat rigid, staring, motionless. For an instant there
was no sound. And then Trevison laughed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; he said; &#8220;I can&#8217;t use your methods! You&#8217;re
safe so long as you don&#8217;t move.&#8221; He laughed again
as he looked down at the banker. Reaching down, he
grasped the inert man by the scruff of the neck and
dragged him through the door, out into the banking
room, past Corrigan, who watched him wonderingly
and to the front, there he dropped him and turning,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
answered the question that he saw shining in Corrigan&#8217;s
eyes:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t work in the dark! We&#8217;ll take this case out
into the sunlight, so the whole town can have a look
at it!&#8221;</p>
<p>He stooped swiftly, grasped Braman around the
middle, swung him aloft and hurled him through the
window, into the street, the glass, shattered, clashing
and jangling around him. He turned to Corrigan,
laughing lowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up. Manti will want to know. I&#8217;m going to
do the talking!&#8221;</p>
<p>He forced Corrigan to the front door, and stood
on the threshold behind him, silent, watching.</p>
<p>A hundred doorways were vomiting men. The crash
of glass had carried far, and visions of a bank robbery
filled many brains as their owners raced toward
the doorway where Trevison stood, the muzzle of his
pistol jammed firmly against Corrigan&#8217;s back.</p>
<p>The crowd gathered, in the manner peculiar to such
scenes, coming from all directions and converging at
one point, massing densely in front of the bank building,
surrounding the fallen banker, pushing, jostling,
straining, craning necks for better views, eager-voiced,
curious.</p>
<p>No one touched Braman. On the contrary, there
were many in the front fringe that braced their bodies
against the crush, shoving backward, crying that a
man was hurt and needed breathing space. They were
unheeded, and when the banker presently recovered consciousness
he was lifted to his feet and stood, pressed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
close to the building, swaying dizzily, pale, weak and
shaken.</p>
<p>Word had gone through the crowd that it was not
a robbery, for there were many there who knew Trevison;
they shouted greetings to him, and he answered
them, standing back of Corrigan, grim and somber.</p>
<p>Foremost in the crowd was Mullarky, who on
another day had seen a fight at this same spot. He had
taken a stand directly in front of the door of the bank,
and had been using his eyes and his wits rapidly since
his coming. And when two or three men from the
crowd edged forward and tried to push their way to
Corrigan, Mullarky drew a pistol, leaped to the door
landing beside Trevison and trained his weapon, on
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand back, or I&#8217;ll plug you, sure as I&#8217;m a foot
high! There&#8217;s hell to pay here, an&#8217; me friend gets a
square deal&mdash;whatever he&#8217;s done!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right!&#8221; came other voices from various points in
the crowd; &#8220;a square deal&mdash;no interference!&#8221;</p>
<p>Judge Lindman came out into the street, urged by
curiosity. He had stepped down from the doorway of
the courthouse and had instantly been carried with the
crowd to a point directly in front of Corrigan and
Trevison, where he stood, bare-headed, pale, watching
silently. Corrigan saw him, and smiled faintly at him.
The easterner&#8217;s eye sought out several faces in the
crowd near him, and when he finally caught the gaze
of a certain individual who had been eyeing him inquiringly
for some moments, he slowly closed an eye and
moved his head slightly toward the rear of the building.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
Instantly the man whistled shrilly with his fingers,
as though to summon someone far down the street,
and slipping around the edge of the crowd made his
way around to the rear of the bank building, where he
was joined presently by other men, roughly garbed, who
carried pistols. One of them climbed in through a
window, opened the door, and the others&mdash;numbering
now twenty-five or thirty, dove into the room.</p>
<p>Out in front a silence had fallen. Trevison had lifted
a hand and the crowd strained its ears to hear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve caught a crook!&#8221; declared Trevison, the frenzy
of fight still surging through his veins. &#8220;He&#8217;s not a
cheap crook&mdash;I give him credit for that. All he wants
to do is to steal the whole county. He&#8217;ll do it, too,
if we don&#8217;t head him off. I&#8217;ll tell you more about him
in a minute. There&#8217;s another of his stripe.&#8221; He
pointed to Braman, who cringed. &#8220;I threw him out
through the window, where the sunlight could shine
on him. He tried to shoot me in the back&mdash;the big
crook here, framed up on me. I want you all to
know what you&#8217;re up against. They&#8217;re after all the
land in this section; they&#8217;ve clouded every title. It&#8217;s
a raw, dirty deal. I see now, why they haven&#8217;t sold a
foot of the land they own here; why they&#8217;ve shoved the
cost of leases up until it&#8217;s ruination to pay them. They&#8217;re
land thieves, commercial pirates. They&#8217;re going to
euchre everybody out of&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevison caught a gasp from the crowd&mdash;concerted,
sudden. He saw the mass sway in unison, stiffen, stand
rigid; and he turned his head quickly, to see the door
behind him, and the broken window through which he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
had thrown Braman&mdash;the break running the entire
width of the building&mdash;filled with men armed with
rifles.</p>
<p>He divined the situation, sensed his danger&mdash;the
danger that faced the crowd should one of its members
make a hostile movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Steady there, boys!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Don&#8217;t start
anything. These men are here through prearrangement&mdash;it&#8217;s
another frame-up. Keep your guns out
of sight!&#8221; He turned, to see Corrigan grinning contemptuously
at him. He met the look with naked exultation
and triumph.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got your body-guard within call, eh?&#8221; he jeered.
&#8220;You need one. You&#8217;ve cut me short, all right; but
I&#8217;ve said enough to start a fire that will rage through
this part of the country until every damned thief is
burned out! You&#8217;ve selected the wrong man for a victim,
Corrigan.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stepped down into the street, sheathing his pistol.
He heard Corrigan&#8217;s voice, calling after him,
saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Grand-stand play again!&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevison turned; the gaze of the two men met, held,
their hatred glowing bitter in their eyes; the gaze
broke, like two sharp blades rasping apart, and Corrigan
turned to his deputies, scowling; while Trevison
pushed his way through the crowd.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, while Corrigan was talking with
the deputies and Braman in the rear room of the bank
building, Trevison was standing in the courthouse talking
with Judge Lindman. The Judge stared out into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
the street at some members of the crowd that still
lingered.</p>
<p>&#8220;This town will be a volcano of lawlessness if it
doesn&#8217;t get a square deal from you, Lindman,&#8221; said
Trevison. &#8220;You have seen what a mob looks like.
You&#8217;re the representative of justice here, and if we
don&#8217;t get justice we&#8217;ll come and hang you in spite of
a thousand deputies! Remember that!&#8221;</p>
<p>He stalked out, leaving behind him a white-faced,
trembling old man who was facing a crisis which made
the future look very black and dismal. He was wondering
if, after all, hanging wouldn&#8217;t be better than
the sunlight shining on a deed which each day he
regretted more than on the preceding day. And Trevison,
riding Nigger out of town, was estimating the probable
effect of his crowd-drawing action upon Judge
Lindman, and considering bitterly the perfidy of the
woman who had cleverly drawn him on, to betray him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>ANOTHER LETTER</h3>
</div>

<p>That afternoon, Corrigan rode to the Bar B. The
ranchhouse was of the better class, big, imposing,
well-kept, with a wide, roofed porch running across
the front and partly around both sides. It stood in a
grove of fir-balsam and cottonwood, on a slight eminence,
and could be seen for miles from the undulating
trail that led to Manti. Corrigan arrived shortly after
noon, to find Rosalind gone, for a ride, Agatha told
him, after she had greeted him at the edge of the
porch.</p>
<p>Agatha had not been pleased over Rosalind&#8217;s rides
with Trevison as a companion. She was loyal to her
brother, and she did not admire the bold recklessness
that shone so frankly and unmistakably in Trevison&#8217;s
eyes. Had she been Rosalind she would have preferred
the big, sleek, well-groomed man of affairs who had
called today. And because of her preference for Corrigan,
she sat long on the porch with him and told
him many things&mdash;things that darkened the big man&#8217;s
face. And when, as they were talking, Rosalind came,
Agatha discreetly retired, leaving the two alone.</p>
<p>For a time after the coming of Rosalind, Corrigan
sat in a big rocking chair, looking thoughtfully down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
the Manti trail, listening to the girl talk of the country,
picturing her on a distant day&mdash;not too distant,
either, for he meant to press his suit&mdash;sitting beside
him on the porch of another house that he meant to
build when he had achieved his goal. These thoughts
thrilled him as they had never thrilled him until the
entrance of Trevison into his scheme of things. He
had been sure of her then. And now the knowledge
that he had a rival, filled him with a thousand emotions,
the most disturbing of which was jealousy. The rage
in him was deep and malignant as he coupled the mental
pictures of his imagination with the material record
of Rosalind&#8217;s movements with his rival, as related by
Agatha. It was not his way to procrastinate; he meant
to exert every force at his command, quickly, resistlessly,
to destroy Trevison, to blacken him and damn
him, in the eyes of the girl who sat beside him. But
he knew that in the girl&#8217;s presence he must be wise and
subtle.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great country, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he said, his eyes
on the broad reaches of plain, green-brown in the shimmering
sunlight. &#8220;Look at it&mdash;almost as big as some
of the Old-world states! It&#8217;s a wonderful country.
I feel like a feudal baron, with the destinies of an
important principality in the clutch of my hand!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; it must give one a feeling of great responsibility
to know that one has an important part in the
development of a section like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed, deep in his throat, at the awe in her
voice. &#8220;I ought to have seen its possibilities years ago&mdash;I
should have been out here, preparing for this.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
But when I bought the land I had no idea it would
one day be so valuable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bought it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A hundred thousand acres of it. I got it very
cheap.&#8221; He told her about the Midland grant and his
purchase from Marchmont.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard of that before!&#8221; she told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t generally known. In fact, it was apparently
generally considered that the land had been sold
by the Midland Company to various people&mdash;in small
parcels. Unscrupulous agents engineered the sales, I
suppose. But the fact is that I made the purchase from
the Midland Company years ago&mdash;largely as a personal
favor to Jim Marchmont, who needed money
badly. And a great many of the ranch-owners around
here really have no title to their land, and will have
to give it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>She breathed deeply. &#8220;That will be a great disappointment
to them, now that there exists the probability
of a great advance in the value of the land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the owners&#8217; lookout. A purchaser should
see that his deed is clear before closing a deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What owners will be affected?&#8221; She spoke with a
slight breathlessness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many.&#8221; He named some of them, leaving Trevison
to the last, and then watching her furtively out
of the corners of his eyes and noting, with straightened
lips, the quick gasp she gave. She said nothing;
she was thinking of the great light that had been in
Trevison&#8217;s eyes on the day he had told her of his
ten years of exile; she could remember his words, they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
had been vivid fixtures in her mind ever since: &#8220;I
own five thousand acres, and about a thousand acres of
it is the best coal land in the United States. I wouldn&#8217;t
sell it for love or money, for when your father gets
his railroad running, I&#8217;m going to cash in on ten of
the leanest and hardest and lonesomest years that any
man ever put in.&#8221;</p>
<p>How hard it would be for him to give it all up;
to acknowledge defeat, to feel those ten wasted years
behind him, empty, unproductive; full of shattered
hopes and dreams changed to nightmares! She sat,
white of face, gripping the arms of her chair, feeling a
great, throbbing sympathy for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will take it all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will still hold one hundred and sixty acres&mdash;the
quarter-section granted him by the government,
which he has undoubtedly proved on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;&#8221; she began, and paused, for to go further
would be to inject her personal affairs into the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trevison is an evil in the country,&#8221; he went on,
speaking in a judicial manner, but watching her narrowly.
&#8220;It is men like him who retard civilization. He
opposes law and order&mdash;defies them. It is a shock,
I know, to learn that the title to property that you
have regarded as your own for years, is in jeopardy.
But still, a man can play the man and not yield to lawless
impulses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has happened?&#8221; She spoke breathlessly,
for something in Corrigan&#8217;s voice warned her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very little&mdash;from Trevison&#8217;s viewpoint, I suppose,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
he laughed. &#8220;He came into my office this morning,
after being served with a summons from Judge
Lindman&#8217;s court in regard to the title of his land, and
tried to kill me. Failing in that, he knocked poor, inoffensive
little Braman down&mdash;who had interfered in
my behalf&mdash;and threw him bodily through the front
window of the building, glass and all. It&#8217;s lucky for
him that Braman wasn&#8217;t hurt. After that he tried to
incite a riot, which Judge Lindman nipped in the bud by
sending a number of deputies, armed with rifles, to the
scene. It was a wonderful exhibition of outlawry. I
was very sorry to have it happen, and any more such
outbreaks will result in Trevison&#8217;s being jailed&mdash;if not
worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; she panted, in a whisper, and became
lost in deep thought.</p>
<p>They sat for a time, without speaking. She studied
the profile of the man and compared its reposeful
strength with that of the man who had ridden with
her many times since her coming to Blakeley&#8217;s. The
turbulent spirit of Trevison awed her now, frightened
her&mdash;she feared for his future. But she pitied him;
the sympathy that gripped her made icy shivers run
over her.</p>
<p>&#8220;From what I understand, Trevison has always
been a disturber,&#8221; resumed Corrigan. &#8220;He disgraced
himself at college, and afterwards&mdash;to such an extent
that his father cut him off. He hasn&#8217;t changed, apparently;
he is still doing the same old tricks. He had
some sort of a love affair before coming West, your
father told me. God help the girl who marries him!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>The girl flushed at the last sentence; she replied to
the preceding one:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Hester Keyes threw him over, after he broke
with his father.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not see Corrigan&#8217;s eyes quicken, for she was
wondering if, after all, Hester Keyes had not acted
wisely in breaking with Trevison. Certainly, Hester had
been in a position to know him better than some of
those critics who had found fault with her for her
action&mdash;herself, for instance. She sighed, for the
memory of her ideal was dimming. A figure that represented
violence and bloodshed had come in its place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hester Keyes,&#8221; said Corrigan, musingly. &#8220;Did
she marry a fellow named Harvey&mdash;afterwards?
Winslow Harvey, if I remember rightly. He died soon
after?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;do you know her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Slightly.&#8221; Corrigan laughed. &#8220;I knew her father.
Well, well. So Trevison worshiped there, did he?
Was he badly hurt&mdash;do you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Corrigan, getting up, and speaking
lightly, as though dismissing the subject from his mind;
&#8220;I presume he was&mdash;and still is, for that matter. A
person never forgets the first love.&#8221; He smiled at her.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you go with me for a short ride?&#8221;</p>
<p>The ride was taken, but a disturbing question lingered
in Rosalind&#8217;s mind throughout, and would not be solved.
Had Trevison forgotten Hester Keyes? Did he think
of her as&mdash;as&mdash;well, as she, herself, sometimes
thought of Trevison&mdash;as she thought of him now&mdash;with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
a haunting tenderness that made his faults recede,
as the shadows vanish before the sunshine?</p>
<p>What Corrigan thought was expressed in a satisfied
chuckle, as later, he loped his horse toward Manti.
That night he wrote a letter and sent it East. It was
addressed to Mrs. Hester Harvey, and was subscribed:
&#8220;Your old friend, Jeff.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>A RUMBLE OF WAR</h3>
</div>

<p>The train that carried Corrigan&#8217;s letter eastward
bore, among its few other passengers, a young
man with a jaw set like a steel trap, who leaned forward
in his seat, gripping the back of the seat in front
of him; an eager, smoldering light in his eyes, who rose
at each stop the train made and glared belligerently
and intolerantly at the coach ends, muttering guttural
anathemas at the necessity for delays. The spirit of
battle was personified in him; it sat on his squared
shoulders; it was in the thrust of his chin, stuck out as
though to receive blows, which his rippling muscles
would be eager to return. Two other passengers in
the coach watched him warily, and once, when he got
up and walked to the front of the coach, opening the
door and looking out, to let in the roar and whir and
the clatter, one of the passengers remarked to the
other: &#8220;That guy is in a temper where murder would
come easy to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The train left Manti at nine o&#8217;clock in the evening.
At midnight it pulled up at the little frame station in
Dry Bottom and the young man leaped off and strode
rapidly away into the darkness of the desert town. A
little later, J. Blackstone Graney, attorney at law, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
former Judge of the United States District Court at
Dry Bottom, heard a loud hammering on the door of
his residence at the outskirts of town. He got up, with
a grunt of resentment for all heavy-fisted fools abroad
on midnight errands, and went downstairs to admit a
grim-faced stranger who looked positively bloodthirsty
to the Judge, under the nervous tension of his midnight
awakening.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m &#8216;Brand&#8217; Trevison, owner of the Diamond K
ranch, near Manti,&#8221; said the stranger, with blunt sharpness
that made the Judge blink. &#8220;I&#8217;ve a case on in the
Manti court at ten o&#8217;clock tomorrow&mdash;today,&#8221; he corrected.
&#8220;They are going to try to swindle me out of
my land, and I&#8217;ve got to have a lawyer&mdash;a real one.
I could have got half a dozen in Manti&mdash;such as
they are&mdash;but I want somebody who is wise in the
law, and with the sort of honor that money and power
can&#8217;t blast&mdash;I want you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Judge Graney looked sharply at his visitor, and
smiled. &#8220;You are evidently desperately harried. Sit
down and tell me about your case.&#8221; He waved to a
chair and Trevison dropped into it, sitting on its edge.
The Judge took another, and with the kerosene lamp
between them on a table, Trevison related what had
occurred during the previous morning in Manti. When
he concluded, the Judge&#8217;s face was serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;If what you say is true, it is a very awkward, not
to say suspicious, situation. Being the only lawyer in
Dry Bottom, until the coming of Judge Lindman, I
have had occasion many times to consult the record
you speak of, and if my memory serves me well, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
have noted several times&mdash;quite casually, of course,
since I have never been directly concerned with the
records of the land in your vicinity&mdash;that several transfers
of title to the original Midland grant have been
recorded. Your deed would show, of course, the date
of your purchase from Buck Peters, and we shall, perhaps,
be able to determine the authenticity of the present
record in that manner. But if, as you believe, the
records have been tampered with, we are facing a long,
hard legal battle which may or may not result in an
ultimate victory for us&mdash;depending upon the power
behind the interests opposed to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll fight them to the Supreme Court of the United
States!&#8221; declared Trevison. &#8220;I&#8217;ll fight them with
the law or without it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said Graney, with a shrewd glance at
the other&#8217;s grim face. &#8220;But be careful not to do anything
that will jeopardize your liberty. If those men
are what you think they are, they would be only
too glad to have you break some law that would give
them an excuse to jail you. You couldn&#8217;t do much fighting
then, you know.&#8221; He got up. &#8220;There&#8217;s a train
out of here in about an hour&mdash;we&#8217;ll take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>About six o&#8217;clock that morning the two men stepped
off the train at Manti. Graney went directly to a hotel,
to wash and breakfast, while Trevison, a little tired
and hollow-eyed from loss of sleep and excitement, and
with a two days&#8217; growth of beard on his face, which
made him look worse than he actually felt, sought the
livery stable where he had left Nigger the night before,
mounted the animal and rode rapidly out of town
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
toward the Diamond K. He took a trail that led
through the cut where on another morning he had
startled the laborers by riding down the wall&mdash;Nigger
eating up the ground with long, sure, swift strides&mdash;passing
Pat Carson and his men at a point on the level
about a quarter of a mile beyond the cut. He waved a
hand to Carson as he flashed by, and something in
his manner caused Carson to remark to the engineer
of the dinky engine: &#8220;Somethin&#8217;s up wid Trevison
ag&#8217;in, Murph&mdash;he&#8217;s got a domned mean look in his
eye. I&#8217;m the onluckiest son-av-a-gun in the worruld,
Murph! First I miss seein&#8217; this fire-eater bate the
face off the big ilephant, Corrigan, an&#8217; yisterday I was
figgerin&#8217; on goin&#8217; to town&mdash;but didn&#8217;t; an&#8217; I miss
seein&#8217; that little whiffet of a Braman flyin&#8217; through the
windy. Do ye&#8217;s know that there&#8217;s a feelin&#8217; ag&#8217;in Corrigan
an&#8217; the railroad in town, an&#8217; thot this mon Trevison
is the fuse that wud bust the boom av discontint.
I&#8217;m beginnin&#8217; to feel a little excited meself. Now what
do ye suppose that gang av min wid Winchesters was
doin&#8217;, comin&#8217; from thot direction this mornin&#8217;?&#8221; He
pointed toward the trail that Trevison was riding.
&#8220;An&#8217; that big stiff, Corrigan, wid thim!&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevison got the answer to this query the minute he
reached the Diamond K ranchhouse. His foreman
came running to him, pale, disgusted, his voice snapping
like a whip:</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve busted your desk an&#8217; rifled it. Twenty
guys who said they was deputies from the court in
Manti, an&#8217; Corrigan. I was here alone, watchin&#8217;, as
you told me, but couldn&#8217;t move a finger&mdash;damn &#8217;em!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>Trevison dismounted and ran into the house. The
room that he used as an office was in a state of disorder.
Papers, books, littered the floor. It was evident
that a thorough search had been made&mdash;for something.
Trevison darted to the desk and ran a hand into
the pigeonhole in which he kept the deed which he
had come for. The hand came out, empty. He sprang
to the door of a small closet where, in a box that contained
some ammunition that he kept for the use of
his men, he had placed the money that Rosalind Benham
had brought to him. The money was not there.
He walked to the center of the room and stood for
an instant, surveying the mass of litter around him,
reeling, rage-drunken, murder in his heart. Barkwell,
the foreman, watching him, drew great, long breaths
of sympathy and excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I get the boys an&#8217; go after them damn
sneaks?&#8221; he questioned, his voice tremulous. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
clean &#8217;em out&mdash;smoke &#8217;em out of the county!&#8221; he
threatened. He started for the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; Trevison had conquered the first surge
of passion; his grin was cold and bitter as he crossed
glances with his foreman. &#8220;Don&#8217;t do anything&mdash;yet.
I&#8217;m going to play the peace string out. If it doesn&#8217;t
work, why then&mdash;&#8221; He tapped his pistol holster significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You get a few of the boys and stay here with
them. It isn&#8217;t probable that they&#8217;ll try anything like
that again, because they&#8217;ve got what they wanted. But
if they happen to come again, hold them until I come.
I&#8217;m going to court.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span></p>
<p>Later, in Manti, he was sitting opposite Graney in
a room in the hotel to which the Judge had gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m,&#8221; said the latter, compressing his lips; &#8220;that&#8217;s
sharp practice. They are not wasting any time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it legal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The law is elastic&mdash;some judges stretch it more
than others. A search-warrant and a writ of attachment
probably did the business in this case. What I
can&#8217;t understand is why Judge Lindman issued the writ
at all&mdash;if he did so. You are the defendant, and you
certainly would have brought the deed into court as
a means of proving your case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevison had mentioned the missing money, though
he did not think it important to explain where it had
come from. And Judge Graney did not ask him. But
when court opened at the appointed time, with a dignity
which was a mockery to Trevison, and Judge Graney
had explained that he had come to represent the defendant
in the action, he mildly inquired the reason for the
forcible entry into his client&#8217;s house, explaining also
that since the defendant was required to prove his case
it was optional with him whether or not the deed be
brought into court at all.</p>
<p>Corrigan had been on time; he had nodded curtly to
Trevison when he had entered to take the chair in
which he now sat, and had smiled when Trevison had
deliberately turned his back. He smiled when Judge
Graney asked the question&mdash;a faint, evanescent smirk.
But at Judge Lindman&#8217;s reply he sat staring stolidly,
his face an impenetrable mask:</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no mention of a deed in the writ of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
attachment issued by the court. Nor has the court any
knowledge of the existence of such a deed. The officers
of the court were commanded to proceed to the defendant&#8217;s
house, for the purpose of finding, if possible, and
delivering to this court the sum of twenty-seven hundred
dollars, which amount, representing the money
paid to the defendant by the railroad company for certain
grants and privileges, is to remain in possession of
the court until the title to the land in litigation has
been legally awarded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the court officers seized the defendant&#8217;s deed,
also,&#8221; objected Judge Graney.</p>
<p>Judge Lindman questioned a deputy who sat in the
rear of the room. The latter replied that he had seen
no deed. Yes, he admitted, in reply to a question of
Judge Graney&#8217;s, it might have been possible that Corrigan
had been alone in the office for a time.</p>
<p>Graney looked inquiringly at Corrigan. The latter
looked steadily back at him. &#8220;I saw no deed,&#8221; he said,
coolly. &#8220;In fact, it wouldn&#8217;t be <i>possible</i> for me to see
any deed, for Trevison has no title to the property he
speaks of.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judge Graney made a gesture of impotence to Trevison,
then spoke slowly to the court. &#8220;I am afraid that
without the deed it will be impossible for us to proceed.
I ask a continuance until a search can be made.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judge Lindman coughed. &#8220;I shall have to refuse
the request. The plaintiff is anxious to take possession of
his property, and as no reason has been shown why
he should not be permitted to do so, I hereby return
judgment in his favor. Court is dismissed.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I give notice of appeal,&#8221; said Graney.</p>
<p>Outside a little later Judge Graney looked gravely
at Trevison. &#8220;There&#8217;s knavery here, my boy; there&#8217;s
some sort of influence behind Lindman. Let&#8217;s see some
of the other owners who are likely to be affected.&#8221;</p>
<p>This task took them two days, and resulted in the
discovery that no other owner had secured a deed to
his land. Lefingwell explained the omission.</p>
<p>&#8220;A sale is a sale,&#8221; he said; &#8220;or a sale <i>has</i> been a
sale until now. Land has changed hands out here
just the same as we&#8217;d trade a horse for a cow or a pipe
for a jack-knife. There was no questions asked. When
a man had a piece of land to sell, he sold it, got his
money an&#8217; didn&#8217;t bother to give a receipt. Half the
damn fools in this country wouldn&#8217;t know a deed from
a marriage license, an&#8217; they haven&#8217;t been needin&#8217; one
or the other. For when a man has a wife she&#8217;s continually
remindin&#8217; him of it, an&#8217; he can&#8217;t forget it&mdash;he&#8217;s
got her. It&#8217;s the same with his land&mdash;he&#8217;s got it.
So far as I know there&#8217;s never been a deed issued for
my land&mdash;or any of the land in that Midland grant,
except Trevison&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks as though Corrigan had considered that
phase of the matter,&#8221; dryly observed Judge Graney.
&#8220;The case doesn&#8217;t look very hopeful. However, I
shall take it before the Circuit Court of Appeals, in
Santa Fe.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was gone a week, and returned, disgusted, but
determined.</p>
<p>&#8220;They denied our appeal; said they might have
considered it if we had some evidence to offer showing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
that we had some sort of a claim to the title. When
I told them of my conviction that the records had been
tampered with, they laughed at me.&#8221; The Judge&#8217;s
eyes gleamed indignantly. &#8220;Sometimes, I feel heartily
in sympathy with people who rail at the courts&mdash;their
attitude is often positively asinine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the long arm of power has reached to
Santa Fe?&#8221; suggested Trevison.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t reach to Washington,&#8221; declared the Judge,
decisively. &#8220;And if you say the word, I&#8217;ll go there and
see what I can do. It&#8217;s an outrage!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was hoping you&#8217;d go&mdash;there&#8217;s no limit,&#8221; said
Trevison. &#8220;But as I see the situation, everything
depends upon the discovery of the original record. I&#8217;m
convinced that it is still in existence, and that Judge
Lindman knows where it is. I&#8217;m going to get it, or&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy, my friend,&#8221; cautioned the Judge. &#8220;I know
how you feel. But you can&#8217;t fight the law with lawlessness.
You lie quiet until you hear from me. That
is all there is to be done, anyway&mdash;win or lose.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevison clenched his teeth. &#8220;I might feel that
way about it, if I had been as careless of my interests
as the other owners here, but I safeguarded my interests,
trusted them to the regularly recognized law out
here, and I&#8217;m going to fight for them! Why, good
God, man; I&#8217;ve worked ten years for that land! Do
you think I will see it go <i>without</i> a fight?&#8221; He
laughed, and the Judge shook his head at the sound.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>A MUTUAL BENEFIT ASSOCIATION</h3>
</div>

<p>Unheeding the drama that was rapidly and
invisibly (except for the incident of Braman and
the window) working itself out in its midst, Manti
lunged forward on the path of progress, each day
growing larger, busier, more noisy and more important.
Perhaps Manti did not heed, because Manti was itself
a drama&mdash;the drama of creation. Each resident, each
newcomer, settled quickly and firmly into the place
that desire or ambition or greed urged him; put forth
whatever energy nature had endowed him with, and
pushed on toward the goal toward which the town
was striving&mdash;success; collectively winning, unrecking
of individual failure or tragedy&mdash;those things were
to be expected, and they fell into the limbo of forgotten
things, easily and unnoticed. Wrecks, disasters, were
certain. They came&mdash;turmoil engulfed them.</p>
<p>Which is to say that during the two weeks that had
elapsed since the departure of Judge Graney for Washington,
Manti had paid very little attention to &#8220;Brand&#8221;
Trevison while he haunted the telegraph station and
the post-office for news. He was pointed out, it is
true, as the man who had hurled banker Braman
through the window of his bank building; there was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
a hazy understanding that he was having some sort of
trouble with Corrigan over some land titles, but in the
main Manti buzzed along, busy with its visions and its
troubles, leaving Trevison with his.</p>
<p>The inaction, with the imminence of failure after
ten years of effort, had its effect on Trevison. It fretted
him; he looked years older; he looked worried and
harassed; he longed for a chance to come to grips in
an encounter that would ease the strain. Physical action
it must be, for his brain was a muddle of passion and
hatred in which clear thoughts, schemes, plans, plots,
were swallowed and lost. He wanted to come into
physical contact with the men and things that were
thwarting him; he wanted to feel the thud and jar of
blows; to catch the hot breath of open antagonism; he
yearned to feel the strain of muscles&mdash;this fighting in
the dark with courts and laws and lawyers, according
to rules and customs, filled him with a raging impotence
that hurt him. And then, at the end of two weeks came
a telegram from Judge Graney, saying merely: &#8220;Be
patient. It&#8217;s a long trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevison got on Nigger and returned to the Diamond
K.</p>
<p>The six o&#8217;clock train arrived in Manti that evening
with many passengers, among whom was a woman
of twenty-eight at whom men turned to look the
second time. Her traveling suit spoke eloquently of
that personal quality which a language, seeking new
and expressive phrases describes as &#8220;class.&#8221; It fitted
her smoothly, tightly, revealing certain lines of her
graceful figure that made various citizens of Manti
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
gasp. &#8220;Looks like she&#8217;d been poured into it,&#8221;
remarked an interested lounger. She lingered on the
station platform until she saw her trunks safely deposited,
and then, drawing her skirts as though fearful of
contamination, she walked, self-possessed and cool,
through the doorway of the <i>Castle</i> hotel&mdash;Manti&#8217;s
aristocrat of hostelries.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards she admitted Corrigan to her
room. She had changed from her traveling suit to a
gown of some soft, glossy material that accentuated the
lines revealed by the discarded habit. The worldly-wise
would have viewed the lady with a certain expressive
smile that might have meant much or nothing. And
the lady would have looked upon that smile as she
now looked at Corrigan, with a faint defiance that had
quite a little daring in it. But in the present case
there was an added expression&mdash;two, in fact&mdash;pleasure
and expectancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;I&#8217;m here.&#8221; She bowed, mockingly, laughingly,
compressing her lips as she noted the quick fire
that flamed in her visitor&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all over, Jeff; I won&#8217;t go back to it. If
that&#8217;s why&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he said, smiling as he took the
chair she waved him to; &#8220;I&#8217;ve erased a page or two
from the past, myself. But I can&#8217;t help admiring you;
you certainly are looking fine! What have you been
doing to yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>She draped herself in a chair where she could look
straight at him, and his compliment made her mouth
harden at the corners.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said; &#8220;in your letter you promised
you&#8217;d take me into your confidence. I&#8217;m ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s purely a business proposition. Each realizes
on his effort. You help me to get Rosalind Benham
through the simple process of fascinating Trevison;
I help you to get Trevison by getting Miss Benham.
It&#8217;s a sort of mutual benefit association, as it were.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does Trevison look like, Jeff&mdash;tell me?&#8221;
The woman leaned forward in her chair, her eyes glowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you women!&#8221; said Corrigan, with a gesture
of disgust. &#8220;He&#8217;s a handsome fool,&#8221; he added; &#8220;if
that&#8217;s what you want to know. But I haven&#8217;t any compliments
to hand him regarding his manners&mdash;he&#8217;s a
wild man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to see him!&#8221; breathed the woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, keep your hair on; you&#8217;ll see him soon
enough. But you&#8217;ve got to understand this: He&#8217;s on
my land, and he gets off without further fighting&mdash;if
you can hold him. That&#8217;s understood, eh? You win
him back and get him away from here. If you double-cross
me, he finds out what you are!&#8221; He flung the
words at her, roughly.</p>
<p>She spoke quietly, though color stained her cheeks.
&#8220;Not &#8216;are,&#8217; Jeff&mdash;what I was. That would be bad
enough. But have no fear&mdash;I shall do as you ask.
For I want him&mdash;I have wanted him all the time&mdash;even
during the time I was chained to that little beast,
Harvey. I wouldn&#8217;t have been what I am&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut it out!&#8221; he advised brutally; &#8220;the man always
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
gets the blame, anyway&mdash;so it&#8217;s no novelty to hear
that sort of stuff. So you understand, eh? You choose
your own method&mdash;but get results&mdash;quick! I want
to get that damned fool away from here!&#8221; He got up
and paced back and forth in the room. &#8220;If he takes
Rosalind Benham away from me I&#8217;ll kill him! I&#8217;ll kill
him, anyway!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has it gone very far between them?&#8221; The concern
in her voice brought a harsh laugh from Corrigan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Far enough, I guess. He&#8217;s been riding with her;
every day for three weeks, her aunt told me. He&#8217;s a
fiery, impetuous devil!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; she consoled. &#8220;And now,&#8221; she
directed; &#8220;get out of here. I&#8217;ve been on the go for
days and days, and I want to sleep. I shall go out
to see Rosalind tomorrow&mdash;to surprise her, Jeff&mdash;to
surprise her. Ha, ha!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have a rig here for you at nine o&#8217;clock,&#8221; said
Corrigan. &#8220;Take your trunks&mdash;she won&#8217;t order you
away. Tell her that Trevison sent for you&mdash;don&#8217;t
mention my name; and stick to it! Well, pleasant
dreams,&#8221; he added as he went out.</p>
<p>As the door closed the woman stood looking at it, a
sneer curving her lips.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>WHEREIN A WOMAN LIES</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to welcome me, dearie?&#8221;</p>
<p>From the porch of the Bar B ranchhouse Rosalind
had watched the rapid approach of the buckboard,
and she now stood at the edge of the step leading to
the porch, not more than ten or fifteen feet distant from
the vehicle, shocked into dumb amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes&mdash;of course. That is&mdash;Why, what
on earth brought you out here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A perfectly good train&mdash;as far as your awfully
crude town of Manti; and this&mdash;er&mdash;spring-legged
thing, the rest of the way,&#8221; laughed Hester Harvey.
She had stepped down, a trifle flushed, inwardly amused,
outwardly embarrassed&mdash;which was very good acting;
but looking very attractive and girlish in the simple
dress she had donned for the occasion&mdash;and for the
purpose of making a good impression. So attractive
was she that the contemplation of her brought a sinking
sensation to Rosalind that drooped her shoulders,
and caused her to look around, involuntarily, for something
to lean upon. For there flashed into her mind at
this instant the conviction that she had herself to blame
for this visitation&mdash;she had written to Ruth Gresham,
and Ruth very likely had disseminated the news, after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
the manner of all secrets, and Hester had heard it.
And of course the attraction was &#8220;Brand&#8221; Trevison! A
new emotion surged through Rosalind at this thought,
an emotion so strong that it made her gasp&mdash;jealousy!</p>
<p>She got through the ordeal somehow&mdash;with an
appearance of pleasure&mdash;though it was hard for her
to play the hypocrite! But so soon as she decently
could, without cutting short the inevitable inconsequential
chatter which fills the first moments of renewed
friendships, she hurried Hester to a room and during
her absence sat immovable in her chair on the porch
staring stonily out at the plains.</p>
<p>It was not until half an hour later, when they were
sitting on the porch, that Hester delivered the stroke
that caused Rosalind&#8217;s hands to fall nervelessly into her
lap, her lips to quiver and her eyes to fill with a reflection
of a pain that gripped her hard, somewhere inside.
For Hester had devised her method, as suggested by
Corrigan.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may seem odd to you&mdash;if you know anything
of the manner of my breaking off with Trevison Brandon&mdash;but
he wrote me about a month ago, asking me
to come out here. I didn&#8217;t accept the invitation at
once&mdash;because I didn&#8217;t want him to be too sure, you
know, dearie. Men are always presuming and pursuing,
dearie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you didn&#8217;t hear of Trevison&#8217;s whereabouts
from Ruth Gresham?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no, dearie! He wrote directly to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosalind hadn&#8217;t <i>that</i> to reproach herself with, at
any rate!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I couldn&#8217;t go to his ranch&mdash;the Diamond
K, isn&#8217;t it?&mdash;so, noting from one of the newspapers
that you had come here, I decided to take advantage
of <i>your</i> hospitality. I&#8217;m just wild to see the dear
boy! Is his ranch far? For you know,&#8221; she added,
with a malicious look at the girl&#8217;s pale face; &#8220;I must
not keep him waiting, now that I am here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t find him prosperous.&#8221; It hurt Rosalind
to say that, but the hurt was slightly offset by a savage
resentment that gripped her when she thought of
how quickly Hester had thrown Trevison over when
she had discovered that he was penniless. And she
had a desperate hope that the dismal aspect of Trevison&#8217;s
future would appall Hester&mdash;as it would were
the woman still the mercenary creature she had been
ten years before. But Hester looked at her with grave
imperturbability.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard something about his trouble. About some
land, isn&#8217;t it? I didn&#8217;t learn the particulars. Tell me
about it&mdash;won&#8217;t you, dearie?&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosalind&#8217;s story of Trevison&#8217;s difficulties did not
have the effect that she anticipated.</p>
<p>&#8220;The poor, dear boy!&#8221; said Hester&mdash;and she
seemed genuinely moved. Rosalind gulped hard over
the shattered ruins of this last hope and got up, fighting
against an inhospitable impulse to order Hester
away. She made some slight excuse and slipped to her
room, where she stayed long, elemental passions battling
riotously within her.</p>
<p>She realized now how completely she had yielded to
the spell that the magnetic and impetuous exile had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
woven about her; she knew now that had he pressed
her that day when he had told her of his love for her
she must have surrendered. She thought, darkly, of
his fiery manner that day, of his burning looks, his hot,
impulsive words, of his confidences. Hypocrisy all!
For while they had been together he must have been
thinking of sending for Hester! He had been trifling
with her! Faith in an ideal is a sacred thing, and shattered,
it lights the fires of hate and scorn, and the emotions
that seethed through Rosalind&#8217;s veins as in her
room she considered Trevison&#8217;s unworthiness, finally
developed into a furious vindictiveness. She wished
dire, frightful calamities upon him, and then, swiftly
reacting, her sympathetical womanliness forced the
dark passions back, and she threw herself on the bed,
sobbing, murmuring: &#8220;Forgive me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Later, when she had made herself presentable, she
went downstairs again, concealing her misery behind
a steady courtesy and a smile that sometimes was a
little forced and bitter, to entertain her guest. It was
a long, tiresome day, made almost unbearable by Hester&#8217;s
small talk. But she got through it. And when,
rather late in the afternoon, Hester inquired the way
to the Diamond K, announcing her intention of visiting
Trevison immediately, she gave no evidence of the
shocked surprise that seized her. She coolly helped
Hester prepare for the trip, and when she drove away
in the buckboard, stood on the ground at the edge of
the porch, watching as the buckboard and its occupant
faded into the shimmering haze of the plains.</p>

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>JUSTICE VS. LAW</h3>
</div>

<p>Impatience, intolerable and vicious, gripped
Trevison as he rode homeward after his haunting
vigil at Manti. The law seemed to him to be like
a house with many doors, around and through which
one could play hide and seek indefinitely, with no possibility
of finding one of the doors locked. Judge
Graney had warned him to be cautious, but as he rode
into the dusk of the plains the spirit of rebellion seized
him. Twice he halted Nigger and wheeled him, facing
Manti, already agleam and tumultuous, almost yielding
to his yearning to return and force his enemy to some
sort of physical action, but each time he urged the horse
on, for he could think of no definite plan. He was
half way to the Diamond K when he suddenly started
and sat rigid and erect in the saddle, drawing a deep
breath, his nerves tingling from excitement. He
laughed lowly, exultingly, as men laugh when under
the stress of adversity they devise sudden, bold plans
of action, and responding to the slight knee press Nigger
turned, reared, and then shot like a black bolt
across the plains at an angle that would not take him
anywhere near the Diamond K.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, in a darkness which equaled that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
of the night on which he had carried the limp and drink-saturated
Clay Levins to his wife, Trevison was dismounting
at the door of the gun-man&#8217;s cabin. A little
later, standing in the glare of lamplight that shone
through the open doorway, he was reassuring Mrs.
Levins and asking for her husband. Shortly afterward,
he was talking lowly to Levins as the latter
saddled his pony out at the stable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it&mdash;for you,&#8221; Levins told him. And then
he chuckled. &#8220;It&#8217;ll seem like old times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Justice versus Law, tonight,&#8221; laughed Trevison;
&#8220;it&#8217;s a case of &#8216;the end justifying the means.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Manti never slept. At two o&#8217;clock in the morning
the lights in the gambling rooms of the <i>Belmont</i> and
the <i>Plaza</i> were still flickering streams out into the desert
night; weak strains of discord were being drummed
out of a piano in a dance hall; the shuffling of feet
smote the dead, flat silence of the night with an odd,
weird resonance. Here and there a light burned in
a dwelling or store, or shone through the wall of a tent-house.
But Manti&#8217;s one street was deserted&mdash;the only
peace that Manti ever knew, had descended.</p>
<p>Two men who had dismounted at the edge of town
had hitched their horses in the shadow of a wagon
shed in the rear of a store building, and were making
their way cautiously down the railroad tracks toward
the center of town. They kept in the shadows of the
buildings as much as possible&mdash;for space was valuable
now and many buildings nuzzled the railroad
tracks; but when once they were forced to pass through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
a light from a window their faces were revealed in it
for an instant&mdash;set, grim and determined.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to move quickly,&#8221; said one of the men
as they neared the courthouse; &#8220;it will be daylight soon.
Damn a town that never sleeps!&#8221;</p>
<p>The other laughed lowly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve said the same thing,
often,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Easy now&mdash;here we are!&#8221;</p>
<p>They paused in the shadow of the building and whispered
together briefly. A sound reached their ears
as they stood. Peering around the corner nearest them
they saw the bulk of a man appear. He walked almost
to the corner of the building where they crouched, and
they held their breath, tensing their muscles. Just when
it seemed they must be discovered, the man wheeled,
walked away, and vanished into the darkness toward
the other side of the building. Presently he returned,
and repeated the maneuver. As he vanished the second
time, the larger man of the two in wait, whispered
to the other:</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the sentry! Stand where you are&mdash;I&#8217;ll show
Corrigan&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The words were cut short by the reappearance of the
sentry. He came close to the corner, and wheeled, to
return. A lithe black shape leaped like a huge cat,
and landed heavily on the sentry&#8217;s shoulders, bringing
a pained grunt from him. The grunt died in a gurgle
as iron fingers closed on his throat; he was jammed,
face down, into the dust and held there, smothering,
until his body slacked and his muscles ceased rippling.
Then a handkerchief was slipped around his mouth
and drawn tightly. He was rolled over, still unconscious,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
his hands tied behind him. Then he was borne
away into the darkness by the big man, who carried
him as though he were a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;Locked in a box-car,&#8221; whispered the big man, returning:
&#8220;They&#8217;ll get him; they&#8217;re half unloaded.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without further words they returned to the shadow
of the building.</p>
<p>Judge Lindman had not been able to sleep until long
after his usual hour for retiring. The noise, and certain
thoughts, troubled him. It was after midnight
when he finally sought his cot, and he was in a heavy
doze until shortly after two, when a breath of air,
chilled by its clean sweep over the plains, searched him
out and brought him up, sitting on the edge of the cot,
shivering.</p>
<p>The rear door of the courthouse was open. In front
of the iron safe at the rear of the room he saw a man,
faintly but unmistakably outlined in the cross light from
two windows. He was about to cry out when his throat
was seized from behind and he was borne back on the
cot resistlessly. Held thus, a voice which made him
strain his eyes in an effort to see the owner&#8217;s face, hissed
in his ear:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to kill you, but I&#8217;ll do it if you cry
out! I mean business! Do you promise not to betray
us?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge wagged his head weakly, and the grip
on his throat relaxed. He sat up, aware that the fingers
were ready to grip his throat again, for he could
feel the big shape lingering beside him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This is an outrage!&#8221; he gasped, shuddering. &#8220;I
know you&mdash;you are Trevison. I shall have you punished
for this.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other laughed lowly and vibrantly. &#8220;That&#8217;s
your affair&mdash;if you dare! You say a word about this
visit and I&#8217;ll feed your scoundrelly old carcass to the
coyotes! Justice is abroad tonight and it won&#8217;t be
balked. I&#8217;m after that original land record&mdash;and I&#8217;m
going to have it. You know where it is&mdash;you&#8217;ve got
it. Your face told me that the other day. You&#8217;re only
half-heartedly in this steal. Be a man&mdash;give me the
record&mdash;and I&#8217;ll stand by you until hell freezes over!
Quick! Is it in the safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge wavered in agonized indecision. But
thoughts of Corrigan&#8217;s wrath finally conquered.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&mdash;it isn&#8217;t in the safe,&#8221; he said. And then, aware
of his error because of the shrill breath the other drew,
he added, quaveringly: &#8220;There is no&mdash;the original
record is in my desk&mdash;you&#8217;ve seen it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; The big shape backed away&mdash;two or
three feet, whispering back at the Judge. &#8220;Open your
mouth and you&#8217;re a dead man. I&#8217;ve got you covered!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cowering on his cot the Judge watched the big shape
join the other at the safe. How long it remained there,
he did not know. A step sounded in the silence that
reigned outside&mdash;a third shape loomed in the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judge Lindman!&#8221; called a voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-es?&#8221; quavered the Judge, aware that the big
shape in the room was now close to him, menacing him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your door&#8217;s open! Where&#8217;s Ed? There&#8217;s something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
wrong! Get up and strike a light. There&#8217;ll be
hell to pay if Corrigan finds out we haven&#8217;t been watching
your stuff. Damn it! A man can&#8217;t steal time for
a drink without something happens. Jim and Bill
and me just went across the street, leaving Ed here.
They&#8217;re coming right&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He had been entering the room while talking, fingering
in his pockets for a match. His voice died in a
quick gasp as Trevison struck with the butt of his
pistol. The man fell, silently.</p>
<p>Another voice sounded outside. Trevison crouched
at the doorway. A form darkened the opening. Trevison
struck, missed, a streak of fire split the night&mdash;the
newcomer had used his pistol. It went off again&mdash;the
flame-spurt shooting ceilingward, as Levins clinched
the man from the rear. A third man loomed in the
doorway; a fourth appeared, behind him. Trevison
swung at the head of the man nearest him, driving
him back upon the man behind, who cursed, plunging
into the room. The man whom Levins had seized was
shouting orders to the others. But these suddenly
ceased as Levins smashed him on the head with the
butt of a pistol. Two others remained. They were
stubborn and courageous. But it was miserable work,
in the dark&mdash;blows were misdirected, friend striking
friend; other blows went wild, grunts of rage and
impotent curses following. But Trevison and Levins
were intent on escaping&mdash;a victory would have been
hollow&mdash;for the thud and jar of their boots on the
bare floor had been heard; doors were slamming; from
across the street came the barking of a dog; men were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
shouting questions at one another; from the box-car
on the railroad tracks issued vociferous yells and curses.
Trevison slipped out through the door, panting. His
opponent had gone down, temporarily disabled from
sundry vicious blows from a fist that had worked like
a piston rod. A figure loomed at his side. &#8220;I got
mine!&#8221; it said, triumphantly; &#8220;we&#8217;d better slope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Another five minutes and I&#8217;d have cracked it,&#8221;
breathed Levins as they ran. &#8220;What&#8217;s Corrigan havin&#8217;
the place watched for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got me. Afraid of the Judge, maybe. The
Judge hasn&#8217;t his whole soul in this deal; it looks to me
as though Corrigan is forcing him. But the Judge has
the original record, all right; and it&#8217;s in that safe, too!
God! If they&#8217;d only given us a minute or two longer!&#8221;</p>
<p>They fled down the track, running heavily, for the
work had been fast and the tension great, and when
they reached the horses and threw themselves into the
saddles, Manti was ablaze with light. As they raced
away in the darkness a grim smile wreathed Trevison&#8217;s
face. For though he had not succeeded in this
enterprise, he had at least struck a blow&mdash;and he had
corroborated his previous opinion concerning Judge
Lindman&#8217;s knowledge of the whereabouts of the original
record.</p>
<p>It was three o&#8217;clock and the dawn was just breaking
when Trevison rode into the Diamond K corral and
pulled the saddle from Nigger. Levins had gone
home.</p>
<p>Trevison was disappointed. It had been a bold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
scheme, and well planned, and it would have succeeded
had it not been for the presence of the sentries. He
had not anticipated that. He laughed grimly, remembering
Judge Lindman&#8217;s fright. Would the Judge
reveal the identity of his early-morning visitor? Trevison
thought not, for if the original record were in the
safe, and if for any reason the Judge wished to conceal
its existence from Corrigan, a hint of the identity
of the early-morning visitors&mdash;especially of one&mdash;might
arouse Corrigan&#8217;s suspicions.</p>
<p>But what if Corrigan knew of the existence of the
original record? There was the presence of the guards
to indicate that he did. But there was Judge Lindman&#8217;s
half-heartedness to disprove that line of reasoning.
Also, Trevison was convinced that if Corrigan
knew of the existence of the record he would destroy
it; it would be dangerous, in the hands of an enemy.
But it would be an admirable weapon of self-protection
in the hands of a man who had been forced into wrong-doing&mdash;in
the hands of Judge Lindman, for instance.
Trevison opened the door that led to his office, thrilling
with a new hope. He lit a match, stepped across
the floor and touched the flame to the wick of the kerosene
lamp&mdash;for it was not yet light enough for him
to see plainly in the office&mdash;and stood for an instant
blinking in its glare. A second later he reeled back
against the edge of the desk, his hands gripping it,
dumb, amazed, physically sick with a fear that he had
suddenly gone insane. For in a big chair in a corner of
the room, sleepy-eyed, tired, but looking very becoming
in her simple dress with a light cloak over it, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
collar turned up, so that it gave her an appearance of
attractive negligence, a smile of delighted welcome on
her face, was Hester Harvey.</p>
<p>She got up as he stood staring dumfoundedly at her
and moved toward him, with an air of artful supplication
that brought a gasp out of him&mdash;of sheer relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you welcome me, Trev? I have come very
far, to see you.&#8221; She held out her hands and went
slowly toward him, mutely pleading, her eyes luminous
with love&mdash;which she did not pretend, for the boy
she had known had grown into the promise of his youth&mdash;big,
magnetic&mdash;a figure for any woman to love.</p>
<p>He had been looking at her intently, narrowly, searchingly.
He saw what she herself had not seen&mdash;the
natural changes that ten years had brought to her. He
saw other things&mdash;that she had not suspected&mdash;a certain
blasé sophistication; a too bold and artful expression
of the eyes&mdash;as though she knew their power
and the lure of them; the slightly hard curve in the
corners of her mouth; a second character lurking
around her&mdash;indefinite, vague, repelling&mdash;the subconscious
self, that no artifice can hide&mdash;the sin and the
shame of deeds unrepented. If there had been a time
when he had loved her, its potence could not leap the
lapse of years and overcome his repugnance for her
kind, and he looked at her coldly, barring her progress
with a hand, which caught her two and held them in
a grip that made her wince.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here? How did you get in?
When did you come?&#8221; He fired the questions at her
roughly, brutally.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Trev.&#8221; She gulped, her smile fading palely.
The conquest was not to be the easy one she had thought&mdash;though
she really wanted him&mdash;more than ever,
now that she saw she was in danger of losing him.
She explained, earnestly pleading with eyes that had
lost their power to charm him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard you were here&mdash;that you were in trouble.
I want to help you. I got here night before last&mdash;to
Manti. Rosalind Benham had written about you to
Ruth Gresham&mdash;a friend of hers in New York. Ruth
Gresham told me. I went directly from Manti to
Benham&#8217;s ranch. Then I came here&mdash;about dusk, last
night. There was a man here&mdash;your foreman, he
said. I explained, and he let me in. Trev&mdash;won&#8217;t you
welcome me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve been in trouble.&#8221; His
laugh was harsh; it made her cringe and cry:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve repented for that. I shouldn&#8217;t have done it;
I don&#8217;t know what was the matter with me. Harvey
had been telling me things about you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have believed him&mdash;&#8221; He laughed,
cynically. &#8220;There&#8217;s no use of haggling over <i>that</i>&mdash;it&#8217;s
buried, and I&#8217;ve placed a monument over it: &#8216;Here
lies a fool that believed in a woman.&#8217; I don&#8217;t reproach
you&mdash;you couldn&#8217;t be blamed for not wanting to marry
an idiot like me. But I haven&#8217;t changed. I still have
my crazy ideas of honor and justice and square-dealing,
and my double-riveted faith in my ability to triumph
over all adversity. But women&mdash;Bah! you&#8217;re
all alike! You scheme, you plot, you play for place;
you are selfish, cold; you snivel and whine&mdash;There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
is more of it, but I can&#8217;t think of any more. But&mdash;let&#8217;s
face this matter squarely. If you still like me, I&#8217;m
sorry for you, for I can&#8217;t say that the sight of you has
stirred any old passion in me. You shouldn&#8217;t have
come out here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re terribly resentful, Trev. And I don&#8217;t
blame you a bit&mdash;I deserve it all. But don&#8217;t send
me away. Why, I&mdash;love you, Trev; I&#8217;ve loved you
all these years; I loved you when I sent you away&mdash;while
I was married to Harvey; and more afterwards&mdash;and
now, deeper than ever; and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head and looked at her steadily&mdash;cynicism,
bald derision in his gaze. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry; but
it can&#8217;t be&mdash;you&#8217;re too late.&#8221;</p>
<p>He dropped her hands, and she felt of the fingers
where he had gripped them. She veiled the quick,
savage leap in her eyes by drooping the lids.</p>
<p>&#8220;You love Rosalind Benham,&#8221; she said, quietly,
looking at him with a mirthless smile. He started, and
her lips grew a trifle stiff. &#8220;You poor boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why the pity?&#8221; he said grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because she doesn&#8217;t care for you, Trev. She told
me yesterday that she was engaged to marry a man
named Corrigan. He is out here, she said. She
remarked that she had found you very amusing during
the three or four weeks of Corrigan&#8217;s absence, and
she seemed delighted because the court out here had
ruled that the land you thought was yours belongs to
the man who is to be her husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stiffened at this, for it corroborated Corrigan&#8217;s
words: &#8220;She is heart and soul with me in this deal,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
She is ambitious.&#8221; Trevison&#8217;s lips curled scornfully.
First, Hester Keyes had been ambitious, and now it
was Rosalind Benham. He fought off the bitter resentment
that filled him and raised his head, laughing, glossing
over the hurt with savage humor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m doing some good in the world, after
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trev,&#8221; Hester moved toward him again, &#8220;don&#8217;t
talk like that&mdash;it makes me shiver. I&#8217;ve been through
the fire, boy&mdash;we&#8217;ve both been through it. I wasted
myself on Harvey&mdash;you&#8217;ll do the same with Rosalind
Benham. Ten years, boy&mdash;think of it! I&#8217;ve loved
you for that long. Doesn&#8217;t that make you understand&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing quite so dead as a love that a man
doesn&#8217;t want to revive,&#8221; he said shortly; &#8220;do you
understand that?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shuddered and paled, and a long silence came
between them. The cold dawn that was creeping over
the land stole into the office with them and found the
fires of affection turned to the ashes of unwelcome
memory. The woman seemed to realize at last, for
she gave a little shiver and looked up at Trevison with
a wan smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I think I understand, Trev. Oh, I am <i>so</i> sorry!
But I am not going away. I am going to stay in Manti,
to be near you&mdash;if you want me. And you will want
me, some day.&#8221; She went close to him. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you
kiss me&mdash;once, Trev? For the sake of old times?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go,&#8221; he said gruffly, turning his head.
And then, as she opened the door and stood upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
threshold, he stepped after her, saying: &#8220;I&#8217;ll get your
horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s two of them,&#8221; she laughed tremulously.
&#8220;I came in a buckboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two, then,&#8221; he said soberly as he followed her
out. &#8220;And say&mdash;&#8221; He turned, flushing. &#8220;You came
at dusk, last night. I&#8217;m afraid I haven&#8217;t been exactly
thoughtful. Wait&mdash;I&#8217;ll rustle up something to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t touch it, thank you. Trev&mdash;&#8221; She
started toward him impulsively, but he turned his back
grimly and went toward the corral.</p>
<p>Sunrise found Hester back at the Bar B. Jealous,
hurt eyes had watched from an upstairs window the
approach of the buckboard&mdash;had watched the Diamond
K trail the greater part of the night. For, knowing
of the absence of women at the Diamond K, Rosalind
had anticipated Hester&#8217;s return the previous
evening&mdash;for the distance that separated the two
ranches was not more than two miles. But the girl&#8217;s
vigil had been unrewarded until now. And when at
last she saw the buckboard coming, scorn and rage,
furious and deep, seized her. Ah, it was bold, brazen,
disgraceful!</p>
<p>But she forced herself to calmness as she went down
stairs to greet her guest&mdash;for there might have been
some excuse for the lapse of propriety&mdash;some accident&mdash;something,
anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;I expected you last night,&#8221; she said as she met
Hester at the door. &#8220;You were delayed I presume.
Has anything happened?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, dearie.&#8221; Only the bold significance of
Hester&#8217;s smile hid its deliberate maliciousness. &#8220;Trev
was so glad to see me that he simply wouldn&#8217;t let me
go. And it was daylight before we realized it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl gasped. And now, looking at the woman,
she saw what Trevison had seen&mdash;staring back at her,
naked and repulsive. She shuddered, and her face
whitened.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are hotels at Manti, Mrs. Harvey,&#8221; she said
coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, very well!&#8221; The woman did not change her
smile. &#8220;I shall be very glad to take advantage of your
kind invitation. For Trev tells me that presently there
will be much bitterness between your crowd and himself,
and I am certain that he wouldn&#8217;t want me to
stay here. If you will kindly have a man bring my
trunks&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>And so she rode toward Manti. Not until the varying
undulations of the land hid her from view of the
Bar B ranchhouse did she lose the malicious smile.
Then it faded, and furious sobs of disappointment shook
her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>LAW INVOKED AND DEFIED</h3>
</div>

<p>As soon as the deputies had gone, two of them
nursing injured heads, and all exhibiting numerous
bruises, Judge Lindman rose and dressed. In the
ghostly light preceding the dawn he went to the safe,
his fingers trembling so that he made difficult work with
the combination. He got a record from out of the
safe, pulled out the bottom drawer, of a series filled
with legal documents and miscellaneous articles, laid
the record book on the floor and shoved the drawer
in over it. An hour later he was facing Corrigan, who
on getting a report of the incident from one of the deputies,
had hurried to get the Judge&#8217;s version. The Judge
had had time to regain his composure, though he was
still slightly pale and nervous.</p>
<p>The Judge lied glibly. He had seen no one in the
courthouse. His first knowledge that anyone had been
there had come when he had heard the voice of one,
of the deputies, calling to him. And then all he had
seen was a shadowy figure that had leaped and struck.
After that there had been some shooting. And then
the men had escaped.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one spoke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a word,&#8221; said the Judge. &#8220;That is, of course,
no one but the man who called to me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did they take anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is there to take? There is nothing of value.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gieger says one of them was working at the safe.
What&#8217;s in there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some books and papers and supplies&mdash;nothing
of value. That they tried to get into the safe would
seem to indicate that they thought there was money
there&mdash;Manti has many strangers who would not hesitate
at robbery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t get into the safe, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t looked inside&mdash;nothing seems to be disturbed,
as it would were the men safe-blowers. In
their hurry to get away it would seem, if they had come
to get into the safe, they would have left something
behind&mdash;tools, or something of that character.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have a look at the safe. Open it!&#8221; Corrigan
seemed to be suspicious, and with a pulse of trepidation,
the Judge knelt and worked the combination.
When the door came open Corrigan dropped on his
knees in front of it and began to pull out the contents,
scattering them in his eagerness. He stood up after
a time, scowling, his face flushed. He turned on the
Judge, grasped him by the shoulders, his fingers gripping
so hard that the Judge winced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Lindman,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those men
were not ordinary robbers. Experienced men would
know better than to crack a safe in a courthouse when
there&#8217;s a bank right next door. I&#8217;ve an idea that it
was some of Trevison&#8217;s work. You&#8217;ve done or said
something that&#8217;s given him the notion that you&#8217;ve got
the original record. Have you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I swear I have said nothing,&#8221; declared the Judge.</p>
<p>Corrigan looked at him steadily for a moment and
then released him. &#8220;You burned it, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge nodded, and Corrigan compressed his
lips. &#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s all right, but I can&#8217;t help wishing
that I had been here to watch the ceremony of burning
that record. I&#8217;d feel a damn sight more secure.
But understand this: If you double-cross me in any
detail of this game, you&#8217;ll never go to the penitentiary
for what Benham knows about you&mdash;I&#8217;ll choke the
gizzard out of you!&#8221; He took a turn around the
room, stopping at last in front of the Judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll talk business. I want you to issue an
order permitting me to erect mining machinery on
Trevison&#8217;s land. We need coal here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Graney gave notice of appeal,&#8221; protested the Judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which the Circuit Court denied.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll go to Washington,&#8221; persisted the Judge,
gulping. &#8220;I can&#8217;t legally do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan laughed. &#8220;Appoint a receiver to operate
the mine, pending the Supreme Court decision. Appoint
Braman. Graney has no case, anyway. There
is no record or deed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no need of haste,&#8221; Lindman cautioned;
&#8220;you can&#8217;t get mining machinery here for some time
yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan laughed, dragging the Judge to a window,
from which he pointed out some flat-cars standing on
a siding, loaded with lumber, machinery, corrugated
iron, shutes, cables, trucks, &#8220;T&#8221; rails, and other articles
that the Judge did not recognize.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>The Judge exclaimed in astonishment. Corrigan
grunted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ordered that stuff six weeks ago, in anticipation of
my victory in your court. You can see how I trusted
in your honesty and perspicacity. I&#8217;ll have it on the
ground tomorrow&mdash;some of it today. Of course I
want to proceed legally, and in order to do that I&#8217;ll
have to have the court order this morning. You do
whatever is necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>At daylight he was in the laborers&#8217; camp, skirting
the railroad at the edge of town, looking for Carson.
He found the big Irishman in one of the larger tent-houses,
talking with the cook, who was preparing breakfast
amid a smother of smoke and the strong mingled
odors of frying bacon and coffee. Corrigan went
only to the flap of the tent, motioning Carson outside.</p>
<p>Walking away from the tent toward some small
frame buildings down the track, Corrigan said:</p>
<p>&#8220;There are several carloads of material there,&#8221;
pointing to the flat-cars which he had shown to the
Judge. &#8220;I&#8217;ve hired a mining man to superintend the
erection of that stuff&mdash;it&#8217;s mining machinery and material
for buildings. I want you to place as many of
your men as you can spare at the disposal of the engineer;
his name&#8217;s Pickand, and you&#8217;ll find him at the
cars at eight o&#8217;clock. I&#8217;ll have some more laborers sent
over from the dam. Give him as many men as he
wants; go with him yourself, if he wants you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are ye goin&#8217; to mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been looking over the land with Pickand; he
says we&#8217;ll sink a shaft at the base of the butte below
the mesa, where you are laying tracks now. We won&#8217;t
have to go far, Pickand says. There&#8217;s coal&mdash;thick
veins of it&mdash;running back into the wall of the butte.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, sir,&#8221; said Carson. But he scratched his
head in perplexity, eyeing Corrigan sidelong. &#8220;Ye
woudn&#8217;t be sayin&#8217; that ye&#8217;ll be diggin&#8217; for coal on the
railroad&#8217;s right av way, wud ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; snapped Corrigan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thin it will be on Trevison&#8217;s land. Have ye bargained
wid him for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! Look here, Carson. Mind your own business
and do as you&#8217;re told!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m elicted, I s&#8217;pose; but it&#8217;s a job I ain&#8217;t admirin&#8217;
to do. If ye&#8217;ve got half the sinse I give ye credit for
havin&#8217;, ye&#8217;ll be lettin&#8217; that mon Trevison alone&mdash;I&#8217;d
a lot sooner smoke a segar in that shed av dynamite
than to cross him!&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan smiled and turned to look in the direction
in which the Irishman was pointing. A small, flat-roofed
frame building, sheathed with corrugated iron,
met his view. Crude signs, large enough to be read
hundreds of feet distant, were affixed to the walls:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;CAUTION. DYNAMITE.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;Do you keep much of it there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough for anny blastin&#8217; we have to do. There&#8217;s
plenty&mdash;half a ton, mebbe.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s got the key?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan returned to town, breakfasted, mounted
a horse and rode out to the dam, where he gave orders
for some laborers to be sent to Carson. At nine o&#8217;clock
he was back in Manti talking with Pickand, and watching
the dinky engine as it pulled the loaded flat-cars
westward over the tracks. He left Pickand and went
to his office in the bank building, where he conferred
with some men regarding various buildings and
improvements in contemplation, and shortly after ten,
glancing out of a window, he saw a buckboard stop in
front of the <i>Castle</i> hotel. Corrigan waited a little,
then closed his desk and walked across the street.
Shortly he confronted Hester Harvey in her room. He
saw from her downcast manner that she had failed. His
face darkened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t work, eh? What did he say?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman was hunched down in her chair, still
wearing the cloak that she had worn in Trevison&#8217;s office;
the collar still up, the front thrown open. Her hair
was disheveled; dark lines were under her eyes; she
glared at Corrigan in an abandon of savage dejection.</p>
<p>&#8220;He turned me down&mdash;cold.&#8221; Her laugh held
the bitterness of self-derision. &#8220;I&#8217;m through, there,
Jeff.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; cursed the man. She looked at him, her
lips curving with amused contempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re all right&mdash;don&#8217;t worry. That&#8217;s all
you care about, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; She laughed harshly at the
quickened light in his eyes. &#8220;You&#8217;d see me sacrifice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
myself; you wouldn&#8217;t give me a word of sympathy.
That&#8217;s you! That&#8217;s the way of all men. Give, give,
give! That&#8217;s the masculine chorus&mdash;the hunting-song
of the human wolf-pack!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk like that&mdash;it ain&#8217;t like you, kid. You
were always the gamest little dame I ever knew.&#8221; He
essayed to take the hand that was twisted in the folds
of her cloak, but she drew it away from him in a fury.
And the eagerness in his eyes betrayed the insincerity
of his attempt at consolation; she saw it&mdash;the
naked selfishness of his look&mdash;and sneered at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want the good news, eh? The good for you?
That&#8217;s all you care about. After you get it, I&#8217;ll get
the husks of your pity. Well, here it is. I&#8217;ve poisoned
them both&mdash;against each other. I told him she was
against him in this land business. And it hurt me to
see how gamely he took it, Jeff!&#8221; her voice broke, but
she choked back the sob and went on, hoarsely: &#8220;He
didn&#8217;t make a whimper. Not even when I told him
you were going to marry her&mdash;that you were engaged.
But there was a fire in those eyes of his that I would
give my soul to see there for me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;yes,&#8221; said the man, impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you devil!&#8221; she railed at him. &#8220;I&#8217;ve made
him think it was a frame-up between you and her&mdash;to
get information out of him; I told him that she
had strung him along for a month or so&mdash;amusing
herself. And he believes it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ve made her believe that he sent for me,&#8221;
she went on, her voice leaping to cold savagery. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
stayed all night at his place, and I went back to the Bar
B in the morning&mdash;this morning&mdash;and made Rosalind
Benham think&mdash;Ha, ha! She ordered me away
from the house&mdash;the hussy! She&#8217;s through with him&mdash;any
fool could tell that. But it&#8217;s different with him,
Jeff. He won&#8217;t give her up; he isn&#8217;t that kind. He&#8217;ll
fight for her&mdash;and he&#8217;ll have her!&#8221;</p>
<p>The eager, pleased light died out of Corrigan&#8217;s face,
his lips set in an ugly pout. But he contrived to smile
as he got up.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done well&mdash;so far. But don&#8217;t give him up.
Maybe he&#8217;ll change his mind. Stay here&mdash;I&#8217;ll stake
you to the limit.&#8221; He laid a roll of bills on a stand&mdash;she
did not look at them&mdash;and approached her in a
second endeavor to console her. But she waved him
away, saying: &#8220;Get out of here&mdash;I want to think!&#8221;
And he obeyed, looking back before he closed the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Selfish?&#8221; he muttered, going down the street.
&#8220;Well, what of it? That&#8217;s a human weakness, isn&#8217;t
it? Get what you want, and to hell with other people!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Trevison had gone to his room for a much-needed
rest. He had watched Hester Harvey go with no conscious
regret, but with a certain grim pity, which was
as futile as her visit. But, lying on the bed he fought
hard against the bitter scorn that raged in him over
the contemplation of Rosalind Benham&#8217;s duplicity. He
found it hard to believe that she had been duping him,
for during the weeks of his acquaintance with her he
had studied her much&mdash;with admiration-weighted
prejudice, of course, since she made a strong appeal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
to him&mdash;and he had been certain, then, that she was
as free from guile as a child&mdash;excepting any girl&#8217;s
natural artifices by which she concealed certain emotions
that men had no business trying to read. He had
read some of them&mdash;his business or not&mdash;and he had
imagined he had seen what had fired his blood&mdash;a
reciprocal affection. He would not have declared himself,
otherwise.</p>
<p>He went to sleep, thinking of her. He awoke about
noon, to see Barkwell standing at his side, shaking him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you got any understandin&#8217; with that railroad
gang that they&#8217;re to do any minin&#8217; on the Diamond K
range?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;re gettin&#8217; ready to do it. Over at the
butte near the railroad cut. I passed there a while ago
an&#8217; quizzed the big guy&mdash;Corrigan&mdash;about a gang
workin&#8217; there. He says they&#8217;re goin&#8217; to mine coal.
I asked him if he had your permission an&#8217; he said he
didn&#8217;t need it. I reckon they ain&#8217;t none shy on gall
where that guy come from!&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevison got out of bed and buckled on his cartridge
belt and pistol. &#8220;The boys are working the Willow
Creek range,&#8221; he said, sharply. &#8220;Get them, tell
them to load up with plenty of cartridges, and join me
at the butte.&#8221;</p>
<p>He heard Barkwell go leaping down the stairs, his
spurs striking the step edges, and a few minutes later,
riding Nigger out of the corral he saw the foreman
racing away in a dust cloud. He followed the bed of
the river, himself, going at a slow lope, for he wanted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
time to think&mdash;to gain control of the rage that boiled
in his veins. He conquered it, and when he came in
sight of the butte he was cool and deliberate, though
on his face was that &#8220;mean&#8221; look that Carson had
once remarked about to his friend Murphy, partly hidden
by the &#8220;tiger&#8221; smile which, the Irishman had discovered,
preceded action, ruthless and swift.</p>
<p>The level below the butte was a-buzz with life and
energy. Scores of laborers were rushing about under
the direction of a tall, thin, bespectacled man who
seemed to be the moving spirit in all the activity. He
shouted orders to Carson&mdash;Trevison saw the big figure
of the Irishman dominating the laborers&mdash;who
repeated them, added to them; sending men scampering
hither and thither. Pausing at a little distance
down the level, Trevison watched the scene. At first
all seemed confusion, but presently he was able to
discern that method ruled. For he now observed that
the laborers were divided into &#8220;gangs.&#8221; Some were
unloading the flat-cars, others were &#8220;assembling&#8221; a
stationary engine near the wall of the butte. They had
a roof over it, already. Others were laying tracks that
intersected with the main line; still others were erecting
buildings along the level. They were on Trevison&#8217;s
land&mdash;there was no doubt of that. Moreover,
they were erecting their buildings and apparatus at the
point where Trevison himself had contemplated making
a start. He saw Corrigan seated on a box on one
of the flat-cars, smoking a cigar; another man, whom
Trevison recognized as Gieger&mdash;he would have been
willing to swear the man was one of those who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
thwarted his plans in the courthouse&mdash;standing beside
him, a Winchester rifle resting in the hollow of his left
arm. Trevison urged Nigger along the level, down
the track, and halted near Corrigan and Gieger. He
knew that Corrigan had seen him, but it pleased the
other to pretend that he had not.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is your work, Corrigan&mdash;I take it?&#8221; said
Trevison, bluntly.</p>
<p>Corrigan turned slowly. He was a good actor, for
he succeeded in getting a fairly convincing counterfeit
of surprise into his face as his gaze fell on his enemy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have taken it correctly, sir.&#8221; He smiled
blandly, though there was a snapping alertness in his
eyes that belied his apparent calmness. He turned to
Gieger, ignoring Trevison. &#8220;Organization is the
thing. Pickand is a genius at it,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Trevison&#8217;s eyes flamed with rage over this deliberate
insult. But in it he saw a cold design to make him lose
his temper. The knowledge brought a twisting smile to
his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have permission to begin this work, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan turned again, as though astonished at the
persistence of the other. &#8220;Certainly, sir. This work
is being done under a court order, issued this morning.
I applied for it yesterday. I am well within my legal
rights, the court having as you are aware, settled the
question of the title.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I have appealed the case?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not been informed that you have done so.
In any event such an appeal would not prevent me mining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
the coal on the property, pending the hearing of
the case in the higher court. Judge Lindman has appointed
a receiver, who is bonded; and the work is to
proceed under his direction. I am here merely as an
onlooker.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked fairly at Trevison, his eyes gleaming
with cold derision. The expression maddened the other
beyond endurance, and his eyes danced the chill glitter
of meditated violence, unrecking consequences.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a sneaking crook, Corrigan, and you know
it! You&#8217;re going too far! You&#8217;ve had Braman appointed
in order to escape the responsibility! You&#8217;re
hiding behind him like a coward! Come out into the
open and fight like a man!&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan&#8217;s face bloated poisonously, but he made
no hostile move. &#8220;I&#8217;ll kill you for that some day!&#8221;
he whispered. &#8220;Not now,&#8221; he laughed mirthlessly as
the other stiffened; &#8220;I can&#8217;t take the risk right now&mdash;I&#8217;ve
too much depending on me. But you&#8217;ve been
damned impertinent and troublesome, and when I get
you where I want you I&#8217;m going to serve you like this!&#8221;
And he took the cigar from his mouth, dropped it to
the floor of the car and ground it to pieces under his
heel. He looked up again, at Trevison, and their
gaze met, in each man&#8217;s eyes glowed the knowledge of
imminent action, ruthless and terrible.</p>
<p>Trevison broke the tension with a laugh that came
from between his teeth. &#8220;Why delay?&#8221; he mocked.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been ready for the grinding process since the first
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough of this!&#8221; Corrigan turned to Gieger with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
a glance of cold intolerance. &#8220;This man is a nuisance,&#8221;
he said to the deputy. &#8220;Carry out the mandate of the
court and order him away. If he doesn&#8217;t go, kill him!
He is a trespasser, and has no right here!&#8221; And he
glared at Trevison.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to get out, mister,&#8221; said the deputy.
He tapped his rifle menacingly, betraying a quick accession
of rage that he caught, no doubt, from Corrigan.
Trevison smiled coldly, and backed Nigger a little.
For an instant he meditated resistance, and dropped
his right hand to the butt of his pistol. A shout distracted
his attention. It came from behind him&mdash;it
sounded like a warning, and he wheeled, to see Carson
running toward him, not more than ten feet distant,
waving his hands, a huge smile on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Domned if it ain&#8217;t Trevison!&#8221; he yelled as he
lunged forward and caught Trevison&#8217;s right hand in his
own, pulling the rider toward him. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been wantin&#8217;
to spake a word wid ye for two weeks now&mdash;about thim
cows which me brother in Illinoy has been askin&#8217; me
about, an&#8217; divvil a chance have I had to see ye!&#8221; And
as he yanked Trevison&#8217;s shoulders downward with a
sudden pressure that there was no resisting, he whispered,
rapidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Diputies&mdash;thirty av thim wid Winchesters&mdash;on
the other side av the flat-cars. It&#8217;s a thrap to do away
wid ye&mdash;I heard &#8217;em cookin&#8217; it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; ye wudn&#8217;t be sellin&#8217; &#8217;em to me at twinty-five,
eh?&#8221; he said, aloud. &#8220;Go &#8217;long wid ye&mdash;ye&#8217;re a
domned hold-up man, like all the rist av thim!&#8221; And
he slapped the black horse playfully in the ribs and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
laughed gleefully as the animal lunged at him, ears
laid back, mouth open.</p>
<p>His eyes cold, his lips hard and straight, Trevison
spurred the black again to the flat-car.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bars are down between us, Corrigan; it&#8217;s man
to man from now on. Law or no law, I give you
twenty-four hours to get your men and apparatus off
my land. After that I won&#8217;t be responsible for what
happens!&#8221; He heard a shout behind him, a clatter,
and he turned to see ten or twelve of his men racing
over the level toward him. At the same instant he
heard a sharp exclamation from Corrigan; heard Gieger
issue a sharp order, and a line of men raised their
heads above the flat-cars, rifles in their hands, which
they trained on the advancing cowboys.</p>
<p>Nigger leaped; his rider holding up one hand, the
palm toward his men, as a sign to halt, while he charged
into them. Trevison talked fast to them, while the
laborers, suspending work, watched, muttering; and
the rifles, resting on the flat-cars, grew steadier in their
owners&#8217; hands. The silence grew deeper; the tension
was so great that when somewhere a man dropped a
shovel, it startled the watchers like a sudden bomb.</p>
<p>It was plain that Trevison&#8217;s men wanted to fight. It
was equally plain that Trevison was arguing to dissuade
them. And when, muttering, and casting belligerent
looks backward, they finally drew off, Trevison following,
there was a sigh of relief from the watchers,
while Corrigan&#8217;s face was black with disappointment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>A WOMAN RIDES IN VAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>Out of Rosalind Benham&#8217;s resentment against
Trevison for the Hester Harvey incident grew a
sudden dull apathy&mdash;which presently threatened to
become an aversion&mdash;for the West. Its crudeness,
the uncouthness of its people; the emptiness, the monotony,
began to oppress her. Noticing the waning of her
enthusiasm, Agatha began to inject energetic condemnations
of the country into her conversations with the
girl, and to hint broadly of the contrasting allurements
of the East.</p>
<p>But Rosalind was not yet ready to desert the Bar B.
She had been hurt, and her interest in the country had
dulled, but there were memories over which one might
meditate until&mdash;until one could be certain of some
things. This was hope, insistently demanding delay of
judgment. The girl could not forget the sincere ring
in Trevison&#8217;s voice when he had told her that he would
never go back to Hester Harvey. Arrayed against this
declaration was the cold fact of Hester&#8217;s visit, and
Hester&#8217;s statement that Trevison had sent for her. In
this jumble of contradiction hope found a fertile field.</p>
<p>If Corrigan had anticipated that the knowledge of
Hester&#8217;s visit to Trevison would have the effect of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
centering Rosalind&#8217;s interest on him, he had erred.
Corrigan was magnetic; the girl felt the lure of him.
In his presence she was continually conscious of his
masterfulness, with a dismayed fear that she would
yield to it. She knew this sensation was not love, for
it lacked the fire and the depth of the haunting, breathless
surge of passion that she had felt when she had
held Trevison off the day when he had declared his love
for her&mdash;that she felt whenever she thought of him.
But with Trevison lost to her&mdash;she did not know what
would happen, then. For the present her resentment
was sufficient to keep her mind occupied.</p>
<p>She had a dread of meeting Corrigan this morning.
Also, Agatha&#8217;s continued deprecatory speeches had
begun to annoy her, and at ten o&#8217;clock she ordered one
of the men to saddle her horse.</p>
<p>She rode southward, following a trail that brought
her to Levins&#8217; cabin. The cabin was built of logs,
smoothly hewn and tightly joined, situated at the edge
of some timber in a picturesque spot at a point where a
shallow creek doubled in its sweep toward some broken
country west of Manti.</p>
<p>Rosalind had visited Mrs. Levins many times. The
warmth of her welcome on her first visit had resulted
in a quick intimacy which, with an immediate estimate
of certain needs by Rosalind, had brought her back in
the rôle of Lady Bountiful. &#8220;Chuck&#8221; and &#8220;Sissy&#8221;
Levins welcomed her vociferously as she splashed
across the river to the door of the cabin this morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re clean spoilin&#8217; them, Miss Rosalind!&#8221; declared
the mother, watching from the doorway;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
&#8220;they&#8217;ve got so they expect you to bring them a present
every time you come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sundry pats and kisses sufficed to assuage the pangs
of disappointment suffered by the children, and shortly
afterward Rosalind was inside the cabin, talking with
Mrs. Levins, and watching Clay, who was painstakingly
mending a breach in his cartridge belt.</p>
<p>Rosalind had seen Clay once only, and that at a distance,
and she stole interested glances at him. There
was a certain attraction in Clay&#8217;s lean face, with its
cold, alert furtiveness, but it was an attraction that bred
chill instead of warmth, for his face revealed a wild,
reckless, intolerant spirit, remorseless, contemptuous of
law and order. Several times she caught him watching
her, and his narrowed, probing glances disconcerted
her. She cut her visit short because of his presence,
and when she rose to go he turned in his chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;You like this country, ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;yes. But it is much different, after the
East.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some smoother there, eh? Folks are slicker?&#8221;</p>
<p>She eyed him appraisingly, for there was an undercurrent
of significance in his voice. She smiled. &#8220;Well&mdash;I
suppose so. You see, competition is keener in the
East, and it rather sharpens one&#8217;s wits, I presume.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m. I reckon you&#8217;re right. This railroad has
brought some <i>mighty</i> slick ones here. Mighty slick an&#8217;
gally.&#8221; He looked at her truculently. &#8220;Corrigan&#8217;s
one of the slick ones. Friend of yours, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clay!&#8221; remonstrated his wife, sharply.</p>
<p>He turned on her roughly. &#8220;You keep out of this!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
I ain&#8217;t meanin&#8217; nothin&#8217; wrong. But I reckon when anyone&#8217;s
got a sneakin&#8217; coyote for a friend an&#8217; don&#8217;t know
it, it&#8217;s doin&#8217; &#8217;em a good turn to spit things right out,
frank an&#8217; fair.</p>
<p>&#8220;This Corrigan ain&#8217;t on the level, ma&#8217;am. Do you
know what he&#8217;s doin&#8217;? He&#8217;s skinnin&#8217; the folks in this
country out of about a hundred thousand acres of land.
He&#8217;s clouded every damn title. He&#8217;s got a fake bill
of sale to show that he bought the land years ago&mdash;which
he didn&#8217;t&mdash;an&#8217; he&#8217;s got a little beast of a judge
here to back him up in his play. They&#8217;ve done away
with the original record of the land, an&#8217; rigged up
another, which makes Corrigan&#8217;s title clear. It&#8217;s the
rankest robbery that any man ever tried to pull off,
an&#8217; if he&#8217;s a friend of yourn you ought to cut him off
your visitin&#8217; list!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that? Who told you?&#8221; asked
the girl, her face whitening, for the man&#8217;s vehemence
and evident earnestness were convincing.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Brand&#8217; Trevison told me. It hits him mighty
damned hard. He had a deed to his land. Corrigan
broke open his office an&#8217; stole it. Trevison&#8217;s certain
sure his deed was on the record, for he went to Dry
Bottom with Buck Peters&mdash;the man he bought the
land from&mdash;an&#8217; seen it wrote down on the record!&#8221;
He laughed harshly. &#8220;There&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be hell to pay
here. Trevison won&#8217;t stand for it&mdash;though the other
gillies are advisin&#8217; caution. Caution hell! I&#8217;m for
cleanin&#8217; the scum out! Do you know what Corrigan
done, yesterday? He got thirty or so deputies&mdash;pluguglies
that he&#8217;s hired&mdash;an&#8217; hid &#8217;em behind some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
flat-cars down on the level where they&#8217;re erectin&#8217; some
minin&#8217; machinery. He laid a trap for &#8216;Firebrand,&#8217;
expectin&#8217; him to come down there, rippin&#8217; mad because
they was puttin&#8217; the minin&#8217; machinery up on his land,
wi&#8217;out his permission. They was goin&#8217; to shoot him&mdash;Corrigan
put &#8217;em up to it. That Carson fello&#8217;
heard it an&#8217; put &#8216;Firebrand&#8217; wise. An&#8217; the shootin&#8217;
didn&#8217;t come off. But that&#8217;s only the beginnin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Trevison tell you to tell me this?&#8221; The girl
was stunned, amazed, incredulous. For her father was
concerned in this, and if he had any knowledge that
Corrigan was stealing land&mdash;if he <i>was</i> stealing it&mdash;he
was guilty as Corrigan. If he had no knowledge
of it, she might be able to prevent the steal by communicating
with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trevison tell me?&#8221; laughed Levins, scornfully;
&#8220;&#8216;Firebrand&#8217; ain&#8217;t no pussy-kitten fighter which depends
on women standin&#8217; between him an&#8217; trouble. I&#8217;m tellin&#8217;
you on my own hook, so&#8217;s that big stiff Corrigan won&#8217;t
get swelled up, thinkin&#8217; he&#8217;s got a chance to hitch up
with you in the matrimonial wagon. That guy&#8217;s got
murder in his heart, girl. Did you hear of me shootin&#8217;
that sneak, Marchmont?&#8221; The girl had heard rumors
of the affair; she nodded, and Levins went on. &#8220;It
was Corrigan that hired me to do it&mdash;payin&#8217; me a
thousand, cash.&#8221; His wife gasped, and he spoke gently
to her. &#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Ma; it wasn&#8217;t no cold-blooded
affair&mdash;Jim Marchmont knowed a sister of mine pretty
intimate, when he was out here years ago, an&#8217; I settled
a debt that I thought I owed to her, that&#8217;s all. I ain&#8217;t
none sorry, neither&mdash;I knowed him soon as Corrigan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
mentioned his name. But I hadn&#8217;t no time to call his
attention to things&mdash;I had to plug him, sudden. I&#8217;m
sorry I&#8217;ve said this, ma&#8217;am, now that it&#8217;s out,&#8221; he said
in a changed voice, noting the girl&#8217;s distress; &#8220;but I
felt you ought to know who you&#8217;re dealin&#8217; with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosalind went out, swaying, her knees shaking. She
heard Levins&#8217; wife reproving him; heard the man replying
gruffly. She felt that it <i>must</i> be so. She cared
nothing about Corrigan, beyond a certain regret, but
a wave of sickening fear swept over her at the growing
conviction that her father <i>must</i> know something of all
this. And if, as Levins said, Corrigan was attempting
to defraud these people, she felt that common justice
required that she head him off, if possible. By defeating
Corrigan&#8217;s aim she would, of course, be aiding Trevison,
and through him Hester Harvey, whom she had
grown to despise, but that hatred should not deter her.
She mounted her horse in a fever of anxiety and raced
it over the plains toward Manti, determined to find
Corrigan and force him to tell her the truth.</p>
<p>Half way to town she saw a rider coming, and she
slowed her own horse, taking the rider to be Corrigan,
coming to the Bar B. She saw her mistake when the
rider was within a hundred feet of her. She blushed,
then paled, and started to pass the rider without speaking,
for it was Trevison. She looked up when he
urged Nigger against her animal, blocking the trail,
frowning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; he said; &#8220;what&#8217;s wrong? Why do
you avoid me? I saw you on the Diamond K range
the other day, and when I started to ride toward you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
you whipped up your horse. You tried to pass me just
now. What have I done to deserve it?&#8221;</p>
<p>She could not tell him about Hester Harvey, of
course, and so she was silent, blushing a little. He took
her manner as an indication of guilt, and gritted his
teeth with the pain that the discovery caused him, for
he had been hoping, too&mdash;that his suspicions of her
were groundless.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not care to discuss the matter with you.&#8221; She
looked fairly at him, her resentment flaming in her
eyes, fiercely indignant over his effrontery in addressing
her in that manner, after his affair with Hester Harvey.
She was going to help him, but that did not mean that
she was going to blind herself to his faults, or to accept
them mutely. His bold confidence in himself&mdash;which
she had once admired&mdash;repelled her now; she saw in
it the brazen egotism of the gross sensualist, seeking
new victims.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am in a hurry,&#8221; she said, stiffly; &#8220;you will pardon
me if I proceed.&#8221;</p>
<p>He jumped Nigger off the trail and watched with
gloomy, disappointed eyes, her rapid progress toward
Manti. Then he urged Nigger onward, toward Levins&#8217;
cabin. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to erect another monument to my
faith in women,&#8221; he muttered. And certain reckless,
grim thoughts that had rioted in his mind since the day
before, now assumed a definiteness that made his blood
leap with eagerness.</p>
<p>Later, when Rosalind sat opposite Corrigan at his
desk, she found it hard to believe Levins&#8217; story. The
big man&#8217;s smooth plausibility made Levins&#8217; recital seem
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
like the weird imaginings of a disordered mind, goaded
to desperation by opposition. And again, his magnetism,
his polite consideration for her feelings, his
ingenuous, smiling deference&mdash;so sharply contrasted
with Trevison&#8217;s direct bluntness&mdash;swayed her, and she
sat, perplexed, undecided, when he finished the explanation
she had coldly demanded of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the invariable defense of these squatters,&#8221; he
added; &#8220;that they are being robbed. In this case they
have embellished their hackneyed tale somewhat by
dragging the court into it, and telling you that absurd
story about the shooting of Marchmont. Could you tell
me what possible interest I could have in wanting Marchmont
killed? Don&#8217;t you think, Miss Rosalind, that
Levins&#8217; reference to his sister discloses the real reason
for the man&#8217;s action? Levins&#8217; story that I paid him a
thousand dollars is a fabrication, pure and simple. I
paid Jim Marchmont a thousand dollars that morning,
which was the balance due him on our contract. The
transaction was witnessed by Judge Lindman. After
Marchmont was shot, Levins took the money from
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why wasn&#8217;t Levins arrested?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that public opinion was with Levins. A
great many people here knew of the ancient trouble
between them.&#8221; He passed from that, quickly. &#8220;The
tale of the robbery of Trevison&#8217;s office is childlike, for
the reason that Trevison had no deed. Judge Lindman
is an honored and respected official. And&mdash;&#8221; he
added as a last argument &#8220;&mdash;your father is the respected
head of a large and important railroad. Is it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
logical to suppose that he would lend his influence and
his good name to any such ridiculous scheme?&#8221;</p>
<p>She sighed, almost convinced. Corrigan went on,
earnestly:</p>
<p>&#8220;This man Trevison is a disturber&mdash;he has always
been that. He has no respect for the law or property.
He associates with the self-confessed murderer, Levins.
He is a riotous, reckless, egotistical fool who, because
the law stands in the way of his desires, wishes to
trample it under foot and allow mob rule to take its
place. Do you remember you mentioned that he once
loved a woman named Hester Keyes? Well, he has
brought Hester here&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She got up, her chin at a scornful angle. &#8220;I do not
care to hear about his personal affairs.&#8221; She went out,
mounted her horse, and rode slowly out the Bar B trail.
From a window Corrigan watched her, and as she
vanished into the distance he turned back to his desk,
meditating darkly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trevison put Levins up to that. He&#8217;s showing
yellow.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>AND RIDES AGAIN&mdash;IN VAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>Rosalind&#8217;s reflections as she rode toward the
Bar B convinced her that there had been much
truth in Corrigan&#8217;s arraignment of Trevison. Out of
her own knowledge of him, and from his own admission
to her on the day they had ridden to Blakeley&#8217;s
the first time, she adduced evidence of his predilection
for fighting, of his utter disregard for accepted authority&mdash;when
that authority disagreed with his conception
of justice; of his lawlessness when his desires were
in question. His impetuosity was notorious, for it had
earned him the sobriquet &#8220;Firebrand,&#8221; which he could
not have acquired except through the exhibition of
those traits that she had enumerated.</p>
<p>She was disappointed and spiritless when she reached
the ranchhouse, and very tired, physically. Agatha&#8217;s
questions irritated her, and she ate sparingly of the
food set before her, eager to be alone. In the isolation
of her room she lay dumbly on the bed, and there the
absurdity of Levins&#8217; story assailed her. It must be as
Corrigan had said&mdash;her father was too great a man
to descend to such despicable methods. She dropped
off to sleep.</p>
<p>When she awoke the sun had gone down, and her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
room was cheerless in the semi-dusk. She got up,
washed, combed her hair, and much refreshed, went
downstairs and ate heartily, Agatha watching her narrowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are distraught, my dear,&#8221; ventured her relative.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think this country agrees with you.
Has anything happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl answered evasively, whereat Agatha compressed
her lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that a trip East&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not go home this summer!&#8221; declared Rosalind,
vehemently. And noting the flash in the girl&#8217;s
eyes, belligerent and defiant; her swelling breast, the
warning brilliance of her eyes, misty with pent-up emotion,
Agatha wisely subsided and the meal was finished
in a strained silence.</p>
<p>Later, Rosalind went out, alone, upon the porch
where, huddled in a big rocker, she gazed gloomily at
the lights of Manti, dim and distant. Something of
the turmoil and the tumult of the town in its young
strength and vigor, assailed her, contrasting sharply
with the solemn peace of her own surroundings. Life
had been a very materialistic problem to her, heretofore.
She had lived it according to her environment,
a mere onlooker, detached from the scheme of things.
Something of the meaning of life trickled into her consciousness
as she sat there watching the flickering lights
of the town&mdash;something of the meaning of it all&mdash;the
struggle of these new residents twanged a hidden
chord of sympathy and understanding in her. She was
able to visualize them as she sat there. Faces flashed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
before her&mdash;strong, stern, eager; the owner of each
a-thrill with his ambition, going forward in the march
of progress with definite aim, planning, plotting, scheming&mdash;some
of them winning, others losing, but all
obsessed with a feverish desire of success. The railroad,
the town, the ranches, the new dam, the people&mdash;all
were elements of a conflict, waged ceaselessly.
She sat erect, her blood tingling. Blows were being
struck, taken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she cried, sharply; &#8220;it&#8217;s a game! It&#8217;s the
spirit of the nation&mdash;to fight, to press onward, to
win!&#8221; And in that moment she was seized with a
throbbing sympathy for Trevison, and filled with a
yearning that he might win, in spite of Corrigan, Hester
Harvey, and all the others&mdash;even her father. For he
was a courageous player of this &#8220;game.&#8221; In him was
typified the spirit of the nation.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Rosalind might have added something to her thoughts
had she known of the passions that filled Trevison
when, while she sat on the porch of the Bar B ranchhouse,
he mounted Nigger and sent him scurrying
through the mellow moonlight toward Manti. He was
playing the &#8220;game,&#8221; with justice as his goal. The
girl had caught something of the spirit of it all, but
she had neglected to grasp the all-important element
of the relations between men, without which laws, rules,
and customs become farcical and ridiculous. He was
determined to have justice. He knew well that Judge
Graney&#8217;s mission to Washington would result in failure
unless the deed to his property could be recovered, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
the original record disclosed. Even then, with a weak
and dishonest judge on the bench the issue might be
muddled by a mass of legal technicalities. The court
order permitting Braman to operate a mine on his property
goaded him to fury.</p>
<p>He stopped at Hanrahan&#8217;s saloon, finding Lefingwell
there and talking with him for a few minutes.
Lefingwell&#8217;s docile attitude disgusted him&mdash;he said he
had talked the matter over with a number of the other
owners, and they had expressed themselves as being in
favor of awaiting the result of his appeal. He left
Lefingwell, not trusting himself to argue the question
of the man&#8217;s attitude, and went down to the station,
where he found a telegram awaiting him. It was from
Judge Graney:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>Coming home. Case sent back to Circuit Court for hearing.
Depend on you to get evidence.</p>
</div>
<p>Trevison crumpled the paper and shoved it savagely
into a pocket. He stood for a long time on the station
platform, in the dark, glowering at the lights of the
town, then started abruptly and made his way into the
gambling room of the <i>Plaza</i>, where he somberly
watched the players. The rattle of chips, the whir of
the wheel, the monotonous drone of the faro dealer,
the hum of voices, some eager, some tense, others
exultant or grumbling, the incessant jostling, irritated
him. He went out the front door, stepped down into
the street, and walked eastward. Passing an open space
between two buildings he became aware of the figure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
of a woman, and he wheeled as she stepped forward
and grasped his arm. He recognized her and tried
to pass on, but she clung to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trev!&#8221; she said, appealingly; &#8220;I want to talk
with you. It&#8217;s very important&mdash;really. Just a minute,
Trev. Won&#8217;t you talk <i>that</i> long! Come to my
room&mdash;where&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk fast,&#8221; he admonished, holding her off,&#8220;&mdash;and
talk here.&#8221;</p>
<p>She struggled with him, trying to come closer, twisting
so that her body struck his, and the contact brought
a grim laugh out of him. He seized her by the shoulders
and held her at arm&#8217;s length. &#8220;Talk from there&mdash;it&#8217;s
safer. Now, if you&#8217;ve anything important&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Trev&mdash;please&mdash;&#8221; She laughed, almost sobbing,
but forced the tears back when she saw derision
blazing in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you it was all over!&#8221; He pushed her away
and started off, but he had taken only two steps when
she was at his side again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw you from my window, Trev. I&mdash;I knew it
was you&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t mistake you, anywhere. I followed
you&mdash;saw you go into the <i>Plaza</i>. I came to
warn you. Corrigan has planned to goad you into doing
some rash thing so that he will have an excuse to
jail or kill you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you hear that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I just heard it. I was in the bank today, and
I overheard him talking to a man&mdash;some officer, I
think. Be careful, Trev&mdash;very careful, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Careful as I can,&#8221; he laughed, lowly. &#8220;Thank
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
you.&#8221; He started on again, and she grasped his arm.
&#8220;Trev,&#8221; she pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use, Hester?&#8221; he said; &#8220;it can&#8217;t be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, God bless you, anyway, dear,&#8221; she said chokingly.</p>
<p>He passed on, leaving her in the shadows of the
buildings, and walked far out on the plains. Making
a circuit to avoid meeting the woman again, he skirted
the back yards, stumbling over tin cans and debris in
his progress. When he got to the shed where he had
hitched Nigger he mounted and rode down the railroad
tracks toward the cut, where an hour later he was
joined by Clay Levins, who came toward him, riding
slowly and cautiously.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Patrick Carson had wooed sleep unsuccessfully. For
hours he lay on his cot in the tent, staring out through
the flap at the stars. A vague unrest had seized him.
He heard the hilarious din of Manti steadily decrease
in volume until only intermittent noises reached his
ears. But even when comparative peace came he was
still wide awake.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be gettin&#8217; the willies av I lay here much longer
widout slape,&#8221; he confided to his pillow. &#8220;Mebbe a
turn down the track wid me dujeen wud do the thrick.&#8221;
He got up, lighted his pipe and strode off into the
semi-gloom of the railroad track. He went aimlessly,
paying little attention to objects around him. He passed
the tents wherein the laborers lay&mdash;and smiled as
heavy snores smote his ears. &#8220;They slape a heap
harder than they worruk, bedad!&#8221; he observed, grinning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
&#8220;Nothin&#8217; c&#8217;ud trouble a ginney&#8217;s conscience,
annyway,&#8221; he scoffed. &#8220;But, accordin&#8217; to that they
must be a heap on me own!&#8221; Which observation sent
his thoughts to Corrigan. &#8220;Begob, there&#8217;s a man! A
domned rogue, if iver they was one!&#8221;</p>
<p>He passed the tents, smoking thoughtfully. He
paused when he came to the small buildings scattered
about at quite a distance from the tents, then left the
tracks and made his way through the deep alkali dust
toward them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whativer wud Corrigan be askin&#8217; about the dynamite
for? &#8216;How much do ye kape av it?&#8217; he was askin&#8217;.
As if it was anny av his business!&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped puffing at his pipe and stood rigid, watching
with bulging eyes, for he saw the door of the dynamite
shed move outward several inches, as though someone
inside had shoved it. It closed again, slowly, and
Carson was convinced that he had been seen. He was
no coward, but a cold sweat broke out on him and his
knees doubled weakly. For any man who would visit
the dynamite shed around midnight, in this stealthy
manner, must be in a desperate frame of mind, and
Carson&#8217;s virile imagination drew lurid pictures of a
gun duel in which a stray shot penetrated the wall of
the shed. He shivered at the roar of the explosion that
followed; he even drew a gruesome picture of stretchers
and mangled flesh that brought a groan out of him.</p>
<p>But in spite of his mental stress he lunged forward,
boldly, though his breath wheezed from his lungs in
great gasps. His body lagged, but his will was indomitable,
once he quit looking at the pictures of his imagination.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
He was at the door of the shed in a dozen
strides.</p>
<p>The lock had been forced; the hasp was hanging, suspended
from a twisted staple. Carson had no pistol&mdash;it
would have been useless, anyway.</p>
<p>Carson hesitated, vacillating between two courses.
Should he return for help, or should he secrete himself
somewhere and watch? The utter foolhardiness of
attempting the capture of the prowler single handed
assailed him, and he decided on retreat. He took one
step, and then stood rigid in his tracks, for a voice
filtered thinly through the doorway, hoarse, vibrant:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget the fuses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carson&#8217;s lips formed the word: &#8220;Trevison!&#8221;</p>
<p>Carson&#8217;s breath came easier; his thoughts became
more coherent, his recollection vivid; his sympathies
leaped like living things. When his thoughts dwelt
upon the scene at the butte during Trevison&#8217;s visit while
the mining machinery was being erected&mdash;the trap that
Corrigan had prepared for the man&mdash;a grim smile
wreathed his face, for he strongly suspected what was
meant by Trevison&#8217;s visit to the dynamite shed.</p>
<p>He slipped cautiously around a corner of the shed,
making no sound in the deep dust surrounding it, and
stole back the way he had come, tingling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Begob, I&#8217;ll slape now&mdash;a little while!&#8221;</p>
<p>As Carson vanished down the tracks a head was
stuck out through the doorway of the shed and turned
so that its owner could scan his surroundings.</p>
<p>&#8220;All clear,&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get going, then,&#8221; said another voice, and two men,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
their faces muffled with handkerchiefs, bearing something
that bulked their pockets oddly, slipped out of
the door and fled noiselessly, like gliding shadows,
down the track toward the cut.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Rosalind had been asleep in the rocker. A cool night
breeze, laden with the strong, pungent aroma of sage,
sent a shiver over her and she awoke, to see that the
lights of Manti had vanished. An eerie lonesomeness
had settled around her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it must be nearly midnight!&#8221; she said. She
got up, yawning, and stepped toward the door, wondering
why Agatha had not called her. But Agatha
had retired, resenting the girl&#8217;s manner.</p>
<p>Almost to the door, Rosalind detected movement in
the ghostly semi-light that flooded the plains between
the porch and the picturesque spot, more than a mile
away, on which Levins&#8217; cabin stood. She halted at the
door and watched, and when the moving object resolved
into a horse, loping swiftly, she strained her eyes toward
it. At first it seemed to have no rider, but when it
had approached to within a hundred yards of her,
she gasped, leaped off the porch and ran toward the
horse. An instant later she stood at the animal&#8217;s head,
voicing her astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s Chuck Levins! Why on earth are you
riding around at this hour of the night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sissy&#8217;s sick. Maw wants you to please come an&#8217;
see what you can do&mdash;if it ain&#8217;t too much trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trouble?&#8221; The girl laughed. &#8220;I should say not!
Wait until I saddle my horse!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>She ran to the porch and stole silently into the house,
emerging with a small medicine case, which she stuck
into a pocket of her coat. Once before she had had
occasion to use her simple remedies on Sissy&mdash;an illness
as simple as her remedies; but she could feel something
of Mrs. Levins&#8217; concern for her offspring, and&mdash;and it
was an ideal night for a gallop over the plains.</p>
<p>It was almost midnight by the Levins&#8217; clock when
she entered the cabin, and a quick diagnosis of her case
with an immediate application of one of her remedies,
brought results. At half past twelve Sissy was sleeping
peacefully, and Chuck had dozed off, fully dressed,
no doubt ready to re-enact his manly and heroic rôle
upon call.</p>
<p>It was not until Rosalind was ready to go that Mrs.
Levins apologized for her husband&#8217;s rudeness to his
guest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clay feels awfully bitter against Corrigan. It&#8217;s
because Corrigan is fighting Trevison&mdash;and Trevison
is Clay&#8217;s friend&mdash;they&#8217;ve been like brothers. Trevison
has done so much for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosalind glanced around the cabin. She had meant
to ask Chuck why his father had not come on the midnight
errand, but had forebore. &#8220;Mr. Levins isn&#8217;t
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clay went away about nine o&#8217;clock.&#8221; The woman
did not meet Rosalind&#8217;s direct gaze; she flushed under
it and looked downward, twisting her fingers in her
apron. Rosalind had noted a strangeness in the woman&#8217;s
manner when she had entered the cabin, but she
had ascribed it to the child&#8217;s illness, and had thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
nothing more of it. But now it burst upon her with
added force, and when she looked up again Rosalind
saw there was an odd, strained light in her eyes&mdash;a
fear, a dread&mdash;a sinister something that she shrank
from. Rosalind remembered the killing of Marchmont,
and had a quick divination of impending trouble.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Mrs. Levins? What has happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman gulped hard, and clenched her hands.
Evidently, whatever her trouble, she had determined
to bear it alone, but was now wavering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, Mrs. Levins; perhaps I can help you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can!&#8221; The words burst sobbingly from the
woman. &#8220;Maybe you can prevent it. But, oh, Miss
Rosalind, I wasn&#8217;t to say anything&mdash;Clay told me not
to. But I&#8217;m so afraid! Clay&#8217;s so hot-headed, and
Trevison is so daring! I&#8217;m afraid they won&#8217;t stop at
anything!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is it?&#8221; demanded Rosalind, catching
something of the woman&#8217;s excitement.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about the machinery at the butte&mdash;the mining
machinery. My God, you&#8217;ll never say I told you&mdash;will
you? But they&#8217;re going to blow it up tonight&mdash;Clay
and Trevison; they&#8217;re going to dynamite it! I&#8217;m
afraid there will be murder done!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you tell me before?&#8221; The girl stood
rigid, white, breathless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I ought to,&#8221; moaned the woman. &#8220;But I was
afraid you&#8217;d tell&mdash;Corrigan&mdash;somebody&mdash;and&mdash;and
they&#8217;d get into trouble with the law!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t tell&mdash;but I&#8217;ll stop it&mdash;if there&#8217;s time!
For your sake. Trevison is the one to blame.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>She inquired about the location of the butte; the
shortest trail, and then ran out to her horse. Once in
the saddle she drew a deep breath and sent the animal
scampering into the flood of moonlight.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Down toward the cut the two men ran, and when they
reached a gully at a distance of several hundred feet
from the dynamite shed they came upon their horses.
Mounting, they rode rapidly down the track toward the
butte where the mining machinery was being erected.
They had taken the handkerchiefs off while they ran,
and now Trevison laughed with the hearty abandon of
a boy whose mischievous prank has succeeded.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was easy. I thought I heard a noise, though,
when you backed against the door and shoved it open.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody usually monkeys around a dynamite shed
at night,&#8221; returned Levins. &#8220;Whew! There&#8217;s enough
of that stuff there to blow Manti to Kingdom Come&mdash;wherever
that is.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode boldly across the level at the base of the
butte, for they had reconnoitered after meeting on the
plains just outside of town, and knew Corrigan had
left no one on guard.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a cinch,&#8221; Levins declared as they dismounted
from their horses in the shelter of a shoulder of the
butte, about a hundred yards from where the corrugated
iron building, nearly complete, loomed somberly
on the level. &#8220;But if they&#8217;d ever get evidence that we
done it&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevison laughed lowly, with a grim humor that
made Levins look sharply at him. &#8220;That abandoned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
pueblo on the creek near your shack is built like a fortress,
Levins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What in hell has this job got to do with that dobie
pile?&#8221; questioned the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty. Oh, you&#8217;re curious, now. But I&#8217;m going
to keep you guessing for a day or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll go loco&mdash;give you time,&#8221; scoffed Levins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody else will go crazy when this stuff lets
go,&#8221; laughed Trevison, tapping his pockets.</p>
<p>Levins snickered. They trailed the reins over the
heads of their horses, and walked swiftly toward the
corrugated iron building. Halting in the shadow of it,
they held a hurried conference, and then separated,
Trevison going toward the engine, already set up, with
its flimsy roof covering it, and working around it for a
few minutes, then darting from it to a small building
filled with tools and stores, and to a pile of machinery
and supplies stacked against the wall of the butte.
They worked rapidly, elusive as shadows in the deep
gloom of the wall of the butte, and when their work
was completed they met in the full glare of the moonlight
near the corrugated iron building and whispered
again.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Lashing her horse over a strange trail, Rosalind
Benham came to a thicket of gnarled fir-balsam and
scrub oak that barred her way completely. She had
ridden hard and her horse breathed heavily during the
short time she spent looking about her. Her own
breath was coming sharply, sobbing in her throat, but
it was more from excitement than from the hazard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
and labor of the ride, for she had paid little attention
to the trail, beyond giving the horse direction, trusting
to the animal&#8217;s wisdom, accepting the risks as a matter-of-course.
It was the imminence of violence that had
aroused her, the portent of a lawless deed that might
result in tragedy. She had told Mrs. Levins that she
was doing this thing for <i>her</i> sake, but she knew better.
She <i>did</i> consider the woman, but she realized that her
dominating passion was for the grim-faced young man
who, discouraged, driven to desperation by the force of
circumstances&mdash;just or not&mdash;was fighting for what he
considered were his rights&mdash;the accumulated results of
ten years of exile and work. She wanted to save him
from this deed, from the results of it, even though
there was nothing but condemnation in her heart for
him because of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;To the left of the thicket is a slope,&#8221; Mrs. Levins
had told her. She stopped only long enough to get her
bearings, and at her panting, &#8220;Go!&#8221; the horse leaped.
They were at the crest of the slope quickly, facing the
bottom, yawning, deep, dark. She shut her eyes as
the horse took it, leaning back to keep from falling
over the animal&#8217;s head, holding tightly to the pommel
of the saddle. They got down, someway, and when
she felt the level under them she lashed the horse again,
and urged him around a shoulder of the precipitous
wall that loomed above her, frowning and somber.</p>
<p>She heard a horse whinny as she flashed past the
shoulder, her own beast tearing over the level with
great catlike leaps, but she did not look back, straining
her eyes to peer into the darkness along the wall
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
of the butte for sight of the buildings and machinery.</p>
<p>She saw them soon after passing the shoulder, and
exclaimed her thanks sharply.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;All set,&#8221; said one of the shadowy figures near the
corrugated iron building. A match flared, was applied
to a stick of punk in the hands of each man, and again
they separated, each running, applying the glowing
wand here and there.</p>
<p>Trevison&#8217;s work took him longest, and when he
leaped from the side of a mound of supplies Levins
was already running back toward the shoulder where
they had left their horses. They joined, then split
apart, their weapons leaping into their hands, for they
heard the rapid drumming of horse&#8217;s hoofs.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re coming!&#8221; panted Trevison, his jaws setting
as he plunged on toward the shoulder of the butte.
&#8220;Run low and duck at the flash of their guns!&#8221; he
warned Levins.</p>
<p>A wide swoop brought the oncoming horse around
the shoulder of the butte into full view. As the moonlight
shone, momentarily, on the rider, Trevison cried
out, hoarsely:</p>
<p>&#8220;God, it&#8217;s a woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaped, at the words, out of the shadow of the
butte into the moonlight of the level, straight into the
path of the running horse, which at sight of him slid,
reared and came to a halt, snorting and trembling. Trevison
had recognized the girl; he flung himself at the
horse, muttering: &#8220;Dynamite!&#8221; seized the beast by
the bridle, forced its head around despite the girl&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
objections and incoherent pleadings&mdash;some phrases of
which sank home, but were disregarded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; she cried, fiercely, as he struck the animal
with his fist to accelerate its movements. She was still
crying to him, wildly, hysterically, as he got the animal&#8217;s
head around and slapped it sharply on the hip,
his pistol crashing at its heels.</p>
<p>The frightened animal clattered over the back trail,
Trevison running after it. He reached Nigger, flung
himself into the saddle, and raced after Levins, who
was already far down the level, following Rosalind&#8217;s
horse. At a turn in the butte he came upon them both,
their horses halted, the girl berating Levins, the man
laughing lowly at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; she cried to Trevison as he rode up.
&#8220;Please, Trevison&mdash;don&#8217;t let <i>that</i> happen! It&#8217;s criminal;
it&#8217;s outlawry!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too late,&#8221; he said grimly, and rode close to her
to grasp the bridle of her horse. Standing thus, they
waited&mdash;an age, to the girl, in reality only a few
seconds. Then the deep, solemn silence of the night
was split by a hollow roar, which echoed and re-echoed
as though a thousand thunder storms had centered over
their heads. A vivid flash, extended, effulgent, lit the
sky, the earth rocked, the canyon walls towering above
them seemed to sway and reel drunkenly. The girl
covered her face with her hands. Another blast smote
the night, reverberating on the heels of the other; there
followed another and another, so quickly that they
blended; then another, with a distinct interval between.
Then a breathless, unreal calm, through which distant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
echoes rumbled; then a dead silence, shattered at last
by a heavy, distant clatter, as though myriad big hailstones
were falling on a pavement. And then another
silence&mdash;the period of reeling calm after an earthquake.</p>
<p>&#8220;O God!&#8221; wailed the girl; &#8220;it is horrible!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to get out of here&mdash;the whole of
Manti will be here in a few minutes! Come on!&#8221;</p>
<p>He urged Nigger farther down the canyon, and up
a rocky slope that brought them to the mesa. The
girl was trembling, her breath coming gaspingly. He
faced her as they came to a halt, pityingly, with a certain
dogged resignation in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What brought you here? Who told you we were
here?&#8221; he asked, gruffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter!&#8221; She faced him defiantly. &#8220;You
have outraged the laws of your country tonight! I
hope you are punished for it!&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed, derisively. &#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve seen; you
know. Go and inform your friends. What I have done
I did after long deliberation in which I considered fully
the consequences to myself. Levins wasn&#8217;t concerned
in it, so you don&#8217;t need to mention his name. Your
ranch is in that direction, Miss Benham.&#8221; He pointed
southeastward, Nigger lunged, caught his stride in two
or three jumps, and fled toward the southwest. His
rider did not hear the girl&#8217;s voice; it was drowned in
clatter of hoofs as he and Levins rode.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>ANOTHER WOMAN RIDES</h3>
</div>

<p>Trevison rode in to town the next morning. On
his way he went to the edge of the butte overlooking
the level, and looked down upon the wreck
and ruin he had caused. Masses of twisted steel and
iron met his gaze; the level was littered with debris,
which a gang of men under Carson was engaged in
clearing away; a great section of the butte had been
blasted out, earth, rocks, sand, had slid down upon
much of the wreckage, partly burying it. The utter
havoc of the scene brought a fugitive smile to his lips.</p>
<p>He saw Carson waving a hand to him, and he
answered the greeting, noting as he did so that Corrigan
stood at a little distance behind Carson, watching.
Trevison did not give him a second look,
wheeling Nigger and sending him toward Manti at a
slow lope. As he rode away, Corrigan called to Carson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your friend didn&#8217;t seem to be much surprised.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carson turned, making a grimace while his back was
yet toward Corrigan, but grinning broadly when he
faced around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t he now? I wasn&#8217;t noticin&#8217;. But, begorra,
how c&#8217;ud he be surprised, whin the whole domned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
country was rocked out av its bed be the blast! Wud
ye be expictin&#8217; him to fall over in a faint on beholdin&#8217;
the wreck?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not he,&#8221; said Corrigan, coldly; &#8220;he&#8217;s got too
much nerve for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t he, now!&#8221; Carson looked guilelessly at the
other. &#8220;Wud ye be havin&#8217; anny idee who done it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan&#8217;s eyes narrowed. &#8220;No,&#8221; he said shortly,
and turned away.</p>
<p>Trevison&#8217;s appearance in Manti created a stir. He
had achieved a double result by his deed, for besides
destroying the property and making it impossible for
Corrigan to resume work for a considerable time, he
had caused Manti&#8217;s interest to center upon him sharply,
having shocked into the town&#8217;s consciousness a conception
of the desperate battle that was being waged
at its doors. For Manti had viewed the devastated
butte early that morning, and had come away, seething
with curiosity to get a glimpse of the man whom everybody
secretly suspected of being the cause of it. Many
residents of the town had known Trevison before&mdash;in
half an hour after his arrival he was known to all.
Public opinion was heavily in his favor and many approving
comments were heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t blamin&#8217; him a heap,&#8221; said a man in the <i>Belmont</i>.
&#8220;If things is as you say they are, there ain&#8217;t
much more that a <i>man</i> could do!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The laws is made for the guys with the coin an&#8217;
the pull,&#8221; said another, vindictively.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; dynamite ain&#8217;t carin&#8217; who&#8217;s usin&#8217; it,&#8221; said another,
slyly. Both grinned. The universal sympathy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
for the &#8220;under dog&#8221; oppressed by Justice perverted
or controlled, had here found expression.</p>
<p>It was so all over Manti. Admiring glances followed
Trevison; though he said no word concerning
the incident; nor could any man have said, judging
from the expression of his face, that he was elated.
He had business in Manti&mdash;he completed it, and when
he was ready to go he got on Nigger and loped out of
town.</p>
<p>&#8220;That man&#8217;s nerve is as cold as a naked Eskimo
at the North Pole,&#8221; commented an admirer. &#8220;If I&#8217;d
done a thing like that I&#8217;d be layin&#8217; low to see if any
evidence would turn up against me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon there ain&#8217;t a heap of evidence,&#8221; laughed
his neighbor. &#8220;I expect everybody knows he done it,
but knowin&#8217; an&#8217; provin&#8217; is two different things.&#8221;</p>
<p>A mile out of town Trevison met Corrigan. The
latter halted his horse when he saw Trevison and
waited for him to come up. The big man&#8217;s face wore
an ugly, significant grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did a complete job,&#8221; he said, eyeing the other
narrowly. &#8220;And there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any evidence.
But look out! When a thing like that happens there&#8217;s
always somebody around to see it, and if I can get evidence
against you I&#8217;ll send you up for it!&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted a slight quickening of Trevison&#8217;s eyes at
his mention of a witness, and a fierce exultation leaped
within him.</p>
<p>Trevison laughed, looking the other fairly between
the eyes. Rosalind Benham hadn&#8217;t informed on him.
However, the day was not yet gone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Get your evidence before you try to do any bluffing,&#8221;
he challenged. He spurred Nigger on, not looking
back at his enemy.</p>
<p>Corrigan rode to the laborers&#8217; tents, where he talked
for a time with the cook. In the mess tent he stood
with his back to a rough, pine-topped table, his hands
on its edge. The table had not yet been cleared from
the morning meal, for the cook had been interested in
the explosion. He tried to talk of it with Corrigan,
but the latter adroitly directed the conversation otherwise.
The cook would have said they had a pleasant
talk. Corrigan seemed very companionable this morning.
He laughed a little; he listened attentively when
the cook talked. After a while Corrigan fumbled in
his pockets. Not finding a cigar, he looked eloquently
at the cook&#8217;s pipe, in the latter&#8217;s mouth, belching much
smoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a single cigar,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m dying for a
taste of tobacco.&#8221;</p>
<p>The cook took his pipe from his mouth and wiped
the stem hastily on a sleeve. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t mind I&#8217;ve
been suckin&#8217; on it,&#8221; he said, extending it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t deprive you of it for the world.&#8221; Corrigan
shifted his position, looked down at the table and
smiled. &#8220;Luck, eh?&#8221; he said, picking up a black brier
that lay on the table behind him. &#8220;Got plenty of
tobacco?&#8221;</p>
<p>The cook dove for a box in a corner and returned
with a cloth sack, bulging. He watched while Corrigan
filled the pipe, and grinned while his guest was
lighting it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Carson&#8217;ll be ravin&#8217; today for forgettin&#8217; his pipe.
He must have left it layin&#8217; on the table this mornin&#8217;&mdash;him
bein&#8217; in such a rush to get down, to the explosion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Carson&#8217;s, eh?&#8221; Corrigan surveyed it with
casual interest. &#8220;Well,&#8221; after taking a few puffs &#8220;&mdash;I&#8217;ll
say for Carson that he knows how to take care of
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left shortly afterward, laying the pipe on the
table where he had found it. Five minutes later he was
in Judge Lindman&#8217;s presence, leaning over the desk
toward the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you to issue a warrant for Patrick Carson.
I want him brought in here for examination. Charge
him with being an accessory before the fact, or anything
that seems to fit the case. But throw him into
the cooler&mdash;and keep him there until he talks. He
knows who broke into the dynamite shed, and therefore
he knows who did the dynamiting. He&#8217;s friendly
with Trevison, and if we can make him admit he saw
Trevison at the shed, we&#8217;ve got the goods. He warned
Trevison the other day, when I had the deputies lined
up at the butte, and I found his pipe this morning near
the door of the dynamite shed. We&#8217;ll make him talk,
damn him!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Banker Braman had closed the door between the
front and rear rooms, pulled down the shades of the
windows, lighted the kerosene lamp, and by its wavering
flicker was surveying his reflection in the small mirror
affixed to one of the walls of the building. He was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
pleased, as the fatuous self-complacence of his look
indicated, and carefully, almost fastidiously dressed,
and he could not deny himself this last look into the
mirror, even though he was now five minutes late with
his appointment. The five minutes threatened to
become ten, for, in adjusting his tie-pin it slipped from
his fingers, struck the floor and vanished, as though an
evil fate had gobbled it.</p>
<p>He searched for it frenziedly, cursing lowly, but none
the less viciously. It was quite by accident that when
his patience was strained almost to the breaking point,
he struck his hand against a board that formed part
of the partition between his building and the courthouse
next door, and tore a huge chunk of skin from
the knuckles. He paid little attention to the injury,
however, for the agitating of the board disclosed the
glittering recreant, and he pounced upon it with the
precision of a hawk upon its prey, snarling triumphantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll nail that damned board up, some day!&#8221; he
threatened. But he knew he wouldn&#8217;t, for by lying on
the floor and pulling the board out a trifle, he could get
a clear view of the interior of the courthouse, and
could hear quite plainly, in spite of the presence of a
wooden box resting against the wall on the other side.
And some of the things that Braman had already heard
through the medium of the loose board were really
interesting, not to say instructive, to him.</p>
<p>He was ten minutes late in keeping his appointment.
He might have been even later without being in danger
of receiving the censure he deserved. For the lady
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
received him in a loose wrapper and gracefully disordered
hair, a glance at which made Braman gasp in
unfeigned admiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he demanded with a pretense of
fatherly severity, which he imagined became him very
well in the presence of women. &#8220;Not ready yet, Mrs.
Harvey?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman waved him to a chair with unsmiling
unconcern; dropped into another, crossed her legs and
leaned back in her chair, her hands folded across the
back of her head, her sleeves, wide and flaring, sliding
down below her elbows. She caught Braman&#8217;s burning
stare of interest in this revelation of negligence,
and smiled at him in faint derision.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired, Croft. I&#8217;ve changed my mind about
going to the First Merchants&#8217; Ball. I&#8217;d much rather
sit here and chin you&mdash;if you don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit!&#8221; hastily acquiesced the banker. &#8220;In
fact, I like the idea of staying here much better. It is
more private, you know.&#8221; He grinned significantly,
but the woman&#8217;s smile of faint derision changed merely
to irony, which held steadily, making Braman&#8217;s cheeks
glow crimson.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; she laughed, exulting in her power
over him; &#8220;let&#8217;s get busy. What do you want to chin
about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you after I&#8217;ve wet my whistle,&#8221; said the
banker, gayly. &#8220;I&#8217;m dry as a bone in the middle of
the Sahara desert!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take mine &#8216;straight,&#8217;&#8221; she laughed.</p>
<p>Braman rang a bell. A waiter with glasses and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
bottle appeared, entered, was paid, and departed, grinning
without giving the banker any change from a ten
dollar bill.</p>
<p>The woman laughed immoderately at Braman&#8217;s wolfish
snarl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be a sport, Croft. Don&#8217;t begrudge a poor waiter
a few honestly earned dollars!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, what has the loose-board telephone told
you?&#8221; she asked, two hours later when flushed of face
from frequent attacks on the bottle&mdash;Braman rather
more flushed than she&mdash;they relaxed in their chairs
after a tilt at poker in which the woman had been the
victor.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure you don&#8217;t care for Trevison any more&mdash;that
you&#8217;re only taking his end of this because of
what he&#8217;s been to you in the past?&#8221; demanded the
banker, looking suspiciously at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;He told me he didn&#8217;t love me any more. I couldn&#8217;t
want him after that, could I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think not.&#8221; Braman&#8217;s eyes glowed with
satisfaction. But he hesitated, yielding when she
smiled at him. &#8220;Damn it, I&#8217;d knife Corrigan for you!&#8221;
he vowed, recklessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Save Trevison&mdash;that&#8217;s all I ask. Tell me what
you heard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Corrigan suspects Trevison of blowing up the stuff
at the butte&mdash;as everybody does, of course. He&#8217;s
determined to get evidence against him. He found
Carson&#8217;s pipe at the door of the dynamite shed this
morning. Carson is a friend of Trevison&#8217;s. Corrigan
is going to have Judge Lindman issue a warrant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
for the arrest of Carson&mdash;on some charge&mdash;and
they&#8217;re going to jail Carson until he talks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman cursed profanely, sharply. &#8220;That&#8217;s
Corrigan&#8217;s idea of a square deal. He promised me
that no harm should come to Trevison.&#8221; She got up
and walked back and forth in the room, Braman watching
her with passion lying naked in his eyes, his lips
loose and moist.</p>
<p>She stopped in front of him, finally. &#8220;Go home,
Croft&mdash;there&#8217;s a good boy. I want to think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s cruelty to animals,&#8221; he laughed in a strained
voice. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; he added at signs of displeasure
on her face. &#8220;Can I see you tomorrow night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you know.&#8221; She held the door open for him,
and permitted him to take her hand for an instant.
He squeezed it hotly, the woman making a grimace of
repugnance as she closed the door.</p>
<p>Swiftly she changed from her loose gown to a simple,
short-skirted affair, slipped on boots, a felt hat,
gloves. Leaving the light burning, she slipped out into
the hall and called to the waiter who had served her
and Braman. By rewarding him generously she procured
a horse, and a few minutes later she emerged
from the building by a rear door, mounting the animal
and sending it clattering out into the night.</p>
<p>Twice she lost her way and rode miles before she
recovered her sense of direction, and when she finally
pulled the beast to a halt at the edge of the Diamond K
ranchhouse gallery, midnight was not far away. The
ranchhouse was dark. She smothered a gasp of disappointment
as she crossed the gallery floor. She was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
about to hammer on the door when it swung open and
Trevison stepped out, peered closely at her and laughed
shortly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s you, eh?&#8221; he said. &#8220;I thought I told you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She winced at his tone, but it did not lessen her concern
for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that, Trev! And I don&#8217;t care how you treat
me&mdash;I deserve it! But I can&#8217;t see them punish you&mdash;for
what you did last night!&#8221; She felt him start, his
muscles stiffen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something has turned up, then. You came to warn
me? What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were seen last night! They&#8217;re going to
arrest&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So she squealed, did she?&#8221; he interrupted. He
laughed lowly, bitterly, with a vibrant disappointment
that wrung the woman&#8217;s heart with sympathy. But her
brain quickly grasped the significance of his words, and
longing dulled her sense of honor. It was too good
an opportunity to miss. &#8220;Bah! I expected it. She
told me she would. I was a fool to dream otherwise!&#8221;
He turned on Hester and grasped her by the shoulders,
and her flesh deadened under his fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she tell Corrigan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; The woman told the lie courageously, looking
straight into his eyes, though she shrank at the
fire that came into them as he released her and laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you get your information?&#8221; His voice
was suddenly sullen and cold.</p>
<p>&#8220;From Braman.&#8221;</p>
<p>He started, and laughed in humorous derision.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Braman and Corrigan are blood brothers in this deal.
You must have captivated the little sneak completely
to make him lose his head like that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did it for you, Trev&mdash;for you. Don&#8217;t you see?
Oh, I despise the little beast! But he dropped a hint
one day when I was in the bank, and I deliberately
snared him, hoping I might be able to gain information
that would benefit you. And I have, Trev!&#8221; she
added, trembling with a hope that his hasty judgment
might result to her advantage. And how near she
had come to mentioning Carson&#8217;s name! If Trevison
had waited for just another second before interrupting
her! Fortune had played favorably into her hands
tonight!</p>
<p>&#8220;For you, boy,&#8221; she said, slipping close to him, sinuously,
whispering, knowing the &#8220;she&#8221; he had mentioned
<i>must</i> be Rosalind Benham. &#8220;Old friends are
best, boy. At least they can be depended upon not to
betray one. Trev; let me help you! I can, and I will!
Why, I love you, Trev! And you need me, to help
you fight these people who are trying to ruin you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t understand.&#8221; Trevison&#8217;s voice was cold
and passionless. &#8220;It seems I can&#8217;t <i>make</i> you understand.
I&#8217;m grateful for what you have done for me
tonight&mdash;very grateful. But I can&#8217;t live a lie, woman.
I don&#8217;t love you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you love a woman who has delivered you into
the hands of your enemies,&#8221; she moaned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it,&#8221; he declared hoarsely. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
deny it. I would love her if she sent me to the gallows,
and stood there, watching me die!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>The woman bowed her head, and dropped her hands
listlessly to her sides. In this instant she was thinking
almost the same words that Rosalind Benham had murmured
on her ride to Blakeley&#8217;s, when she had discovered
Trevison&#8217;s identity: &#8220;I wonder if Hester Keyes
knows what she has missed.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>A MAN ERRS&mdash;AND PAYS</h3>
</div>

<p>For a time Trevison stood on the gallery, watching
the woman as she faded into the darkness toward
Manti, and then he laughed mirthlessly and went into
the house, emerging with a rifle and saddle. A few minutes
later he rode Nigger out of the corral and headed
him southwestward. Shortly after midnight he was
at the door of Levins&#8217; cabin. The latter grinned with
feline humor after they held a short conference.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; he said; &#8220;you don&#8217;t need any of
the boys to help you pull <i>that</i> off&mdash;they&#8217;d mebbe go
to actin&#8217; foolish an&#8217; give the whole snap away. Besides,
I&#8217;m a heap tickled to be let in on that sort of a jamboree!&#8221;
There followed an interval, during which
his grin faded. &#8220;So she peached on you, eh? She
told my woman she wouldn&#8217;t. That&#8217;s a woman, ain&#8217;t
it? How&#8217;s a man to tell about &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a secret of my own that I am not ready to
let you in on. Don&#8217;t tell your wife where you are going
<i>tonight</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t reckonin&#8217; to. I&#8217;ll be with you in a jiffy!&#8221;
He vanished into the cabin, reappeared, ran to the stable,
and rode out to meet Trevison. Together they
were swallowed up by the plains.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>At eight o&#8217;clock in the morning Corrigan came out
of the dining-room of his hotel and stopped at the
cigar counter. He filled his case, lit one, and stood
for a moment with an elbow on the glass of the show
case, smoking thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was quite an accident you had at your mine.
Have you any idea who did it?&#8221; asked the clerk, watching
him furtively.</p>
<p>Corrigan glanced at the man, his lips curling.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might guess,&#8221; he said through his teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;That fellow Trevison is a bad actor,&#8221; continued
the clerk. &#8220;And say,&#8221; he went on, confidentially; &#8220;not
that I want to make you feel bad, but the majority of
the people of this town are standing with him in this
deal. They think you are not giving the land-owners
a square deal. Not that I&#8217;m &#8216;knocking&#8217; <i>you</i>,&#8221; the
clerk denied, flushing at the dark look Corrigan threw
him. &#8220;That&#8217;s merely what I hear. Personally, I&#8217;m
for you. This town needs men like you, and it can
get along without fellows like Trevison.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; smiled Corrigan, disgusted with the
man, but feeling that it might be well to cultivate such
ingratiating interest. &#8220;Have a cigar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go you. Yes, sir,&#8221; he added, when he had got
the weed going; &#8220;this town can get along without any
Trevisons. These sagebrush rummies out here give
me a pain. What this country needs is less brute force
and more brains!&#8221; He drew his shoulders erect as
though convinced that he was not lacking in the particular
virtue to which he had referred.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; smiled Corrigan, mildly. &#8220;Brains
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
are all important. A hotel clerk must be well supplied.
I presume you see and hear a great many things that
other people miss seeing and hearing.&#8221; Corrigan
thought this thermometer of public opinion might have
other information.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve said it! We&#8217;ve got to keep our wits about
us. There&#8217;s very little escapes us.&#8221; He leered at Corrigan&#8217;s
profile. &#8220;That&#8217;s a swell Moll in number
eleven, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you know about her?&#8221; Corrigan&#8217;s face
was inexpressive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh say now!&#8221; The clerk guffawed close to Corrigan&#8217;s
ear without making the big man wink an eyelash.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to tell me that you ain&#8217;t <i>on</i>! I saw
you steer to her room one night&mdash;the night she came
here. And once or twice, since. But of course us
hotel clerks don&#8217;t see anything! She is down on the
register as Mrs. Harvey. But say! You don&#8217;t see
any married women running around the country dressed
like her!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She may be a widow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yes, maybe she might. But she shows speed,
don&#8217;t she?&#8221; He whispered. &#8220;You&#8217;re a pretty good
friend of mine, now, and maybe if I&#8217;d give you a tip
you&#8217;d throw something in my way later on&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you might start a hotel here&mdash;or something.
And I&#8217;m thinking of blowing this joint. This town&#8217;s
booming, and it can stand a swell hotel in a few
months.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re on&mdash;if I build a hotel. Shoot!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>The clerk leaned closer, whispering: &#8220;She receives
other men. You&#8217;re not the only one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221;</p>
<p>The clerk laughed, and made a funnel of one hand.
&#8220;The banker across the street&mdash;Braman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan bit his cigar in two, and slowly spat that
which was left in his mouth into a cuspidor. He contrived
to smile, though it cost him an effort, and his
hands were clenched.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many times has he been here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, several.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When was he here last?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night.&#8221; The clerk laughed. &#8220;Looked half
stewed when he left. Kinda hectic, too. Him and her
must have had a tiff, for he left early. And after he&#8217;d
gone&mdash;right away after&mdash;she sent one of the waiters
out for a horse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way did she go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;West&mdash;I watched her; she went the back way,
from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan smiled and went out. The expression of
his face was such as to cause the clerk to mutter,
dazedly: &#8220;He didn&#8217;t seem to be a whole lot interested.
I guess I must have sized him up wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan stopped at his office in the bank, nodding
curtly to Braman. Shortly afterward he got up and
went to the courthouse. He had ordered Judge Lindman
to issue a warrant for Carson the previous morning,
and had intended to see that it was served. But a
press of other matters had occupied his attention until
late in the night.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>He tried the front door of the courthouse, to find
it locked. The rear door was also locked. He tried
the windows&mdash;all were fastened securely. Thinking
the Judge still sleeping he went back to his office and
spent an hour going over some correspondence. At
the end of that time he visited the courthouse again.
Angered, he went around to the side and burst the
flimsy door in, standing in the opening, glowering, for
the Judge&#8217;s cot was empty, and the Judge nowhere to
be seen.</p>
<p>Corrigan stalked through the building, cursing. He
examined the cot, and discovered that it had been slept
in. The Judge must have risen early. Obviously,
there was nothing to do but to wait. Corrigan did that,
impatiently. For a long time he sat in the chair at
his desk, watching Braman, studying him, scowling,
rage in his heart. &#8220;If he&#8217;s up to any dirty work,
I&#8217;ll choke him until his tongue hangs out a yard!&#8221; was
a mental threat that he repeated many times. &#8220;But
he&#8217;s just mush-headed over the woman, I guess&mdash;he&#8217;s
that kind of a fool!&#8221;</p>
<p>At ten o&#8217;clock Corrigan jumped on his horse and
rode out to the butte where the laborers were working,
clearing away the debris from the explosion. No one
there had seen Judge Lindman. Corrigan rode back
to town, fuming with rage. Finding some of the deputies
he sent them out to search for the Judge. One
by one they came in and reported their failure. At
six-thirty, after the arrival of the evening train from
Dry Bottom, Corrigan was sitting at his desk, his face
black with wrath, reading for the third or fourth time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
a letter that he had spread out on the desk before
him:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Mr. Jefferson Corrigan</span>:</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel it is necessary for me to take a short rest.
Recent excitement in Manti has left me very nervous
and unstrung. I shall be away from Manti for about
two weeks, I think. During my absence any pending
litigation must be postponed, of course.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>The letter was signed by Judge Lindman, and postmarked
&#8220;Dry Bottom.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan got up after a while and stuffed the letter
into a pocket. He went out, and when he returned,
Braman had gone out also&mdash;to supper, Corrigan surmised.
When the banker came in an hour later, Corrigan
was still seated at his desk. The banker smiled
at him, and Corrigan motioned to him.</p>
<p>Corrigan&#8217;s voice was silky. &#8220;Where were you last
night, Braman?&#8221;</p>
<p>The banker&#8217;s face whitened; his thoughts became
confused, but instantly cleared when he observed from
the expression of the big man&#8217;s face that the question
was, apparently, a casual one. But he drew his breath
tremulously. One could never be sure of Corrigan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent the night here&mdash;in the back room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you didn&#8217;t see the Judge last night&mdash;or hear
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan drew the Judge&#8217;s letter from the pocket
and passed it over to Braman, watching his face steadily
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
as he read. He saw a quick stain appear in the
banker&#8217;s cheeks, and his own lips tightened.</p>
<p>The banker coughed before he spoke. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t
that a rather abrupt leave-taking?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;rather,&#8221; said Corrigan, dryly. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t
hear him walking about during the night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re rather a heavy sleeper, eh? There is only
a thin board partition between this building and the
courthouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have left after daylight. Of course, any
noise he might have made after that I wouldn&#8217;t have
noticed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, of course not,&#8221; said Corrigan, passionlessly.
&#8220;Well&mdash;he&#8217;s gone.&#8221; He seemed to have dismissed
the matter from his mind and Braman sighed with
relief. But he watched Corrigan narrowly during the
remainder of the time he stayed in the office, and when
he went out, Braman shook a vindictive fist at his
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Worry, damn you!&#8221; he sneered. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
what was in Judge Lindman&#8217;s mind, but I hope he
never comes back! That will help to repay you for
that knockdown!&#8221;</p>
<p>Corrigan went over to the <i>Castle</i> and ate supper.
He was preoccupied and deliberate, for he was trying
to weave a complete fabric out of the threads of Braman&#8217;s
visits to Hester Harvey; Hester&#8217;s ride westward,
and Judge Lindman&#8217;s abrupt departure. He had a feeling
that they were in some way connected.</p>
<p>At a little after seven he finished his meal, went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
upstairs and knocked at the door of Hester Harvey&#8217;s
room. He stepped inside when she opened the door,
and stood, both hands in the pockets of his trousers,
looking at her with a smile of repressed malignance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice night for a ride, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he said, his
lips parting a very little to allow the words to filter
through.</p>
<p>The woman flashed a quick, inquiring look at him,
saw the passion in his eyes, the gleam of malevolent
antagonism, and she set herself against it. For her
talk with Trevison last night had convinced her of the
futility of hope. She had gone out of his life as a
commonplace incident slips into the oblivion of yesteryear.
Worse&mdash;he had refused to recall it. It hurt
her, this knowledge&mdash;his rebuff. It had aroused cold,
wanton passions in her&mdash;she had become a woman
who did not care. She met Corrigan&#8217;s gaze with a
look of defiant mockery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swell. I enjoyed every minute of it. Won&#8217;t you
sit down?&#8221;</p>
<p>He held himself back, grinning coldly, for the woman&#8217;s
look had goaded him to fury.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I&#8217;ll stand. I won&#8217;t be here a minute.
You saw Trevison last night, eh? You warned
him that I was going to have Carson arrested.&#8221; He
had hazarded this guess, for it had seemed to him that
it must be the solution to the mystery, and when he
caught the quick, triumphant light in the woman&#8217;s eyes
at his words he knew he had not erred.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I saw him, and I told him&mdash;what
Braman told me.&#8221; She saw his eyes glitter and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
laughed harshly. &#8220;That&#8217;s what you wanted to know,
isn&#8217;t it, Jeff&mdash;what Braman told me? Well, you
know it. I knew you couldn&#8217;t play square with me.
You thought you could dupe me&mdash;<i>again</i>, didn&#8217;t you?
Well, you didn&#8217;t, for I snared Braman and pumped
him dry. He&#8217;s kept me posted on your movements;
and his little board telephone&mdash;Ha, ha! that makes
you squirm, doesn&#8217;t it? But it was all wasted effort&mdash;Trevison
won&#8217;t have me&mdash;he&#8217;s through. And I&#8217;m
through. I&#8217;m not going to try any more. I&#8217;m going
back East, after I get rested. You fight it out with
Trevison. But I warn you, he&#8217;ll beat you&mdash;and I
wish he would! As for that beast, Braman, I wish&mdash;Ah,
let him go, Jeff,&#8221; she advised, noting the cold fury
in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he said with a dry laugh. &#8220;You
and Braman have done well. It hasn&#8217;t done me any
harm, and so we&#8217;ll forget about it. What do you say
to having a drink&mdash;and a talk. As in old times,
eh?&#8221; He seemed suddenly to have conquered his
passion, but the queer twitching of his lips warned
the woman, and when he essayed to move toward her,
smiling pallidly, she darted to the far side of a stand
near the center of the room, pulled out a drawer, produced
a small revolver and leveled it at him, her eyes
wide and glittering with menace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay where you are, Jeff!&#8221; she ordered. &#8220;There&#8217;s
murder in your heart, and I know it. But I don&#8217;t intend
to be the victim. I&#8217;ll shoot if you come one step
nearer!&#8221;</p>
<p>He smirked at her, venomously. &#8220;All right,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
said. &#8220;You&#8217;re wise. But get out of town on the next
train.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go when I get ready&mdash;you can&#8217;t scare me. Let
me alone or I&#8217;ll go to Rosalind Benham and let her
in on the whole scheme.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes you will&mdash;not,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;If I know anything
about you, you won&#8217;t do anything that would
give Miss Benham to Trevison.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right; I&#8217;d rather see her married to you&mdash;that
would be the refinement of cruelty!&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed sneeringly and stepped out of the door.
Waiting a short time, the woman heard his step in the
hall. Then she darted to the door, locked it, and leaned
against it, panting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done it now,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;Braman&mdash;Well,
it serves him right!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Corrigan stopped in the barroom and got a drink.
Then he walked to the front door and stood in it for
an instant, finally stepping down into the street. Across
the street in the banking room he saw a thin streak
of light gleaming through a crevice in the doorway
that led from the banking room to the rear. The
light told him that Braman was in the rear room.
Selecting a moment when the street in his vicinity was
deserted, Corrigan deliberately crossed, standing for
a moment in the shadow of the bank building, looking
around him. Then he slipped around the building and
tapped cautiously on the rear door. An instant later
he was standing inside the room, his back against the
door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
Braman, arrayed as he had been the night before,
had opened the door. He had been just ready to
go when he heard Corrigan&#8217;s knock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going out, Croft?&#8221; said Corrigan pleasantly, eyeing
the other intently. &#8220;All lit up, too! You&#8217;re getting
to be a gay dog, lately.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was nothing in Corrigan&#8217;s bantering words
to bring on that sudden qualm of sickening fear that
seized the banker. He knew it was his guilt that had
done it&mdash;guilt and perhaps a dread of Corrigan&#8217;s
rage if he <i>should</i> learn of his duplicity. But that word
&#8220;lately&#8221;! If it had been uttered with any sort of an
accent he might have been suspicious. But it had come
with the bantering ring of the others, with no hint
of special significance. And Braman was reassured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m going out.&#8221; He turned to the mirror on
the wall. &#8220;I&#8217;m getting rather stale, hanging around
here so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Croft. Have a good time. How
much money is there in the safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two or three thousand dollars.&#8221; The banker
turned from the glass. &#8220;Want some? Ha, ha!&#8221; he
laughed at the other&#8217;s short nod; &#8220;there are other gay
dogs, I guess! How much do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All you&#8217;ve got?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All! Jehoshaphat! You must have a big deal on
tonight!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, big,&#8221; said Corrigan evenly. &#8220;Get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He followed the banker into the banking room, carefully
closing the door behind him, so that the light
from the rear room could not penetrate. &#8220;That&#8217;s all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
right,&#8221; he reassured the banker as the latter noticed
the action; &#8220;this isn&#8217;t a public matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stuffed his pockets with the money the banker
gave him, and when the other tried to close the door
of the safe he interposed a restraining hand, laughing:</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave it open, Croft. It&#8217;s empty now, and a cracksman
trying to get into it would ruin a perfectly good
safe, for nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>
<p>They went into the rear room again, Corrigan last,
closing the door behind him. Braman went again to
the glass, Corrigan standing silently behind him.</p>
<p>Standing before the glass, the banker was seized
with a repetition of the sickening fear that had
oppressed him at Corrigan&#8217;s words upon his entrance.
It seemed to him that there was a sinister significance
behind Corrigan&#8217;s present silence. A tension came
between them, portentous of evil. Braman shivered,
but the silence held. The banker tried to think of
something to say&mdash;his thoughts were rioting in chaos,
a dumb, paralyzing terror had seized him, his lips
stuck together, the facial muscles refusing their office.
He dropped his hands to his sides and stared into the
glass, noting the ghastly pallor that had come over
his face&mdash;the dull, whitish yellow of muddy marble.
He could not turn, his legs were quivering. He knew
it was conscience&mdash;only that. And yet Corrigan&#8217;s
ominous silence continued. And now he caught his
breath with a shuddering gasp, for he saw Corrigan&#8217;s
face reflected in the glass, looking over his shoulder&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
mirthless smirk on it, the eyes cold, and dancing with
a merciless and cunning purpose. While he watched,
he saw Corrigan&#8217;s lips open:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the board telephone, Braman?&#8221;</p>
<p>The banker wheeled, then. He tried to scream&mdash;the
sound died in a gasping gurgle as Corrigan leaped
and throttled him. Later, he fought to loosen the grip
of the iron fingers at his throat, twisting, squirming,
threshing about the room in his agony. The grip held,
tightened. When the banker was quite still Corrigan
put out the light, went into the banking room, where
he scattered the papers and books in the safe all around
the room. Then he twisted the lock off the door, using
an iron bar that he had noticed in a corner when he
had come in, and stepped out into the shadow of the
building.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>FIRST PRINCIPLES</h3>
</div>

<p>Judge Lindman shivered, though a merciless,
blighting sun beat down on the great stone ledge
that spread in front of the opening, smothering him
with heat waves that eddied in and out, and though the
interior of the low-ceilinged chamber pulsed with the
fetid heat sucked in from the plains generations before.
The adobe walls, gray-black in the subdued light, were
dry as powder and crumbling in spots, the stone floor
was exposed in many places; there was a strange, sickening
odor, as though the naked, perspiring bodies of
inhabitants in ages past had soaked the walls and floor
with the man-scent, and intervening years of disuse
had mingled their musty breath with it. But for the
presence of the serene-faced, steady-eyed young man who
leaned carelessly against the wall outside, whose shoulder
and profile he could see, the Judge might have
yielded completely to the overpowering conviction that
he was dreaming, and that his adventures of the past
twelve hours were horrors of his imagination. But he
knew from the young man&#8217;s presence at the door that
his experience had been real enough, and the knowledge
kept his brain out of the threatening chaos.</p>
<p>Some time during the night he had awakened on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
his cot in the rear room of the courthouse to hear a
cold, threatening voice warning him to silence. He had
recognized the voice, as he had recognized it once
before, under similar conditions. He had been gagged,
his hands tied behind him. Then he had been lifted,
carried outside, placed on the back of a horse, in front
of his captor, and borne away in the darkness. They
had ridden many miles before the horse came to a halt
and he was lifted down. Then he had been forced to
ascend a sharp slope; he could hear the horse clattering
up behind them. But he had not been able to see anything
in the darkness, though he felt he was walking
along the edge of a cliff. The walk had ended abruptly,
when his captor had forced him into his present quarters
with a gruff admonition to sleep. Sleep had come
hard, and he had done little of it, napping merely, sitting
on the stone floor, his back against the wall, most
of the time watching his captor. He had talked some,
asking questions which his captor ignored. Then a
period of oblivion had come, and he had awakened to
the sunshine. For an hour he had sat where he was,
looking out at his captor and blinking at the brilliant
sunshine. But he had asked no questions since awakening,
for he had become convinced of the meaning of
all this. But he was intensely curious, now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where have you brought me?&#8221; he demanded of
his jailor.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re awake, eh?&#8221; Trevison grinned as he
wheeled and looked in at his prisoner. &#8220;This,&#8221; he
waved a hand toward the ledge and its surroundings,
&#8220;is an Indian pueblo, long deserted. It makes an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
admirable prison, Judge. It is also a sort of a fort.
There is only one vulnerable point&mdash;the slope we came
up last night. I&#8217;ll take you on a tour of examination,
if you like. And then you must return here, to stay
until you disclose the whereabouts of the original land
record.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge paled, partly from anger, partly from a
fear that gripped him.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is an outrage, Trevison! This is America!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; The young man smiled imperturbably.
&#8220;There have been times during the past few weeks
when I doubted it, very much. It <i>is</i> America, though,
but it is a part of America that the average American
sees little of&mdash;that he knows little of. As little,
let us say, as he knows of the weird application of its
laws&mdash;as applied by <i>some</i> judges.&#8221; He smiled as
Lindman winced. &#8220;I have given up hoping to secure
justice in the regular way, and so we are in the midst
of a reversion to first principles&mdash;which may lead
us to our goal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That I <i>must</i> have the original record, Judge, I
mean to have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I deny&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;of course. Deny, if you like. We shan&#8217;t
argue. Do you want to explore the place? There will
be plenty of time for talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stepped aside as the Judge came out, and grinned
broadly as he caught the Judge&#8217;s shrinking look at a
rifle he took up as he turned. It had been propped
against the wall at his side. He swung it to the hollow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
of his left elbow. &#8220;Your knowledge of firearms convinces
you that you can&#8217;t run as fast as a rifle bullet,
doesn&#8217;t it, Judge?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge&#8217;s face indicated that he understood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ever make the acquaintance of an Indian pueblo,
Judge?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I came West only a year ago, and I have kept
pretty close to my work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll feel pretty intimate with this one by
the time you leave it&mdash;if you&#8217;re obstinate,&#8221; laughed
Trevison. He stood still and watched the Judge. The
latter was staring hard at his surroundings, perhaps
with something of the awed reverence that overtakes
the tourist when for the first time he views an ancient
ruin.</p>
<p>The pueblo seemed to be nothing more than a jumble
of adobe boxes piled in an indiscriminate heap on
a gigantic stone level surmounting the crest of a hill.
A sheer rock wall, perhaps a hundred feet in height,
descended to the surrounding slopes; the latter sweeping
down to join the plains. A dust, light, dry, and
feathery lay thickly on the adobe boxes on the surrounding
ledge on the slopes, like a gray ash sprinkled
from a giant sifter. Cactus and yucca dotted the slopes,
thorny, lancelike, repellent; lava, dull, hinting of volcanic
fire, filled crevices and depressions, and huge
blocks of stone, detached in the progress of disintegration,
were scattered about.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has taken ages for this to happen!&#8221; the Judge
heard himself murmuring.</p>
<p>Trevison laughed lowly. &#8220;So it has, Judge. Makes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
you think of your school days, doesn&#8217;t it? You hardly
remember it, though. You have a hazy sort of recollection
of a print of a pueblo in a geography, or in a
geological textbook, but at the time you were more interested
in Greek roots, the Alps, Louis Quinze, the heroes
of mythology, or something equally foreign, and you
forgot that your own country might hold something
of interest for you. But the history of these pueblo
towns must be pretty interesting, if one could get at
it. All that I have heard of it are some pretty weird
legends. There can be no doubt, I suppose, that the
people who inhabited these communal houses had laws
to govern them&mdash;and judges to apply the laws. And
I presume that then, as now, the judges were swayed
by powerful influences in&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge glared at his tormentor. The latter
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is reasonable to presume, too,&#8221; he went on,
&#8220;that in some cases the judges rendered some pretty
raw decisions. And carrying the supposition further,
we may believe that then, as now, the poor downtrodden
proletariat got rather hot under the collar. There
are always some hot-tempered fools among all classes
and races that do, you know. They simply can&#8217;t stand
the feel of the iron heel of the oppressor. Can you
picture a hot-tempered fool of that tribe abducting a
judge of the court of his people and carrying him away
to some uninhabited place, there to let him starve until
he decided to do the right thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Starve!&#8221; gasped the Judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;The chambers and tunnels connecting these communal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
houses&mdash;they look like mud boxes, don&#8217;t they,
Judge? And there isn&#8217;t a soul in any of them&mdash;nor a
bite to eat! As I was about to remark, the chambers
and tunnels and the passages connecting these places
are pretty bare and cheerless&mdash;if we except scorpions,
horned toads, centipedes, tarantulas&mdash;and other
equally undesirable occupants. Not a pleasant place
to sojourn in until&mdash;How long can a man live without
eating, Judge? You know, of course, that the
Indians selected an elevated and isolated site, such as
this, because of its strategical advantages? This makes
an ideal fort. Nobody can get into it except by negotiating
the slope we came up last night. And a rifle
in the hands of a man with a yearning to use it would
make <i>that</i> approach pretty unsafe, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; moaned the Judge; &#8220;you talk like a
man bereft of his senses!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or like a man who is determined not to be robbed
of his rights,&#8221; added Trevison. &#8220;Well, come along.
We won&#8217;t dwell on such things if they depress you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took the Judge&#8217;s arm and escorted him. They
circled the broad stone ledge. It ran in wide, irregular
sweeps in the general outline of a huge circle, surrounded
by the dust-covered slopes melting into the
plains, so vast that the eye ached in an effort to comprehend
them. Miles away they could see smoke
befouling the blue of the sky. The Judge knew the
smoke came from Manti, and he wondered if Corrigan
were wondering over his disappearance. He mentioned
that to Trevison, and the latter grinned faintly
at him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I forgot to mention that to you. It was all
arranged last night. Clay Levins went to Dry Bottom
on a night train. He took with him a letter, which
he was to mail at Dry Bottom, explaining your absence
to Corrigan. Needless to say, your signature was
forged. But I did so good a job that Corrigan will
not suspect. Corrigan will get the letter by tonight.
It says that you are going to take a long rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge gasped and looked quickly at Trevison.
The young man&#8217;s face was wreathed in a significant
grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first analysis, this looks like a rather strange
proceeding,&#8221; said Trevison. &#8220;But if you get deeper
into it you see its logic. You know where the original
record is. I want it. I mean to have it. One life&mdash;a
dozen lives&mdash;won&#8217;t stop me. Oh, well, we won&#8217;t
talk about it if you&#8217;re going to shudder that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led the Judge up a flimsy, rotted ladder to a
flat roof, forcing him to look into a chamber where
vermin fled at their appearance. Then through numerous
passages, low, narrow, reeking with a musty odor
that nauseated the Judge; on narrow ledges where they
had to hug the walls to keep from falling, and then
into an open court with a stone floor, stained dark, in
the center a huge oblong block of stone, surmounting
a pyramid, appalling in its somber suggestiveness.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sacrificial altar,&#8221; said Trevison, grimly.
&#8220;These stains here, are&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped, for the Judge had turned his back.</p>
<p>Trevison led him away. He had to help him down
the ladder each time they descended, and when they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
reached the chamber from which they had started the
Judge was white and shaking.</p>
<p>Trevison pushed him inside and silently took a position
at the door. The Judge sank to the floor of the
chamber, groaning.</p>
<p>The hours dragged slowly. Trevison changed his
position twice. Once he went away, but returned in
a few minutes with a canteen, from which he drank,
deeply. The Judge had been without food or water
since the night before, and thirst tortured him. The
gurgle of the water as it came out of the canteen, maddened
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like a drink, Trevison.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. Any man would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I have one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The minute you tell me where that record is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge subsided. A moment later Trevison&#8217;s
voice floated into the chamber, cold and resonant:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re in this thing for money, Judge.
Corrigan has some sort of a hold on you. What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge did not answer.</p>
<p>The sun climbed to the zenith. It grew intensely hot
in the chamber. Twice during the afternoon the Judge
asked for water, and each time he received the answer
he had received before. He did not ask for food, for
he felt it would not be given him. At sundown his captor
entered the chamber and gave him a meager draught
from the canteen. Then he withdrew and stood on
the ledge in front of the door, looking out into the
darkening plains, and watching him, a conviction of the
futility of resisting him seized the Judge. He stood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
framed in the opening of the chamber, the lines of his
bold, strong face prominent in the dusk, the rifle held
loosely in the crook of his left arm, the right hand
caressing the stock, his shoulders squared, his big, lithe,
muscular figure suggesting magnificent physical strength,
as the light in his eyes, the set of his head and the firm
lines of his mouth, brought a conviction of rare courage
and determination. The sight of him thrilled the
Judge; he made a picture that sent the Judge&#8217;s thoughts
skittering back to things primitive and heroic. In an
earlier day the Judge had dreamed of being like him,
and the knowledge that he had fallen far short of
realizing his ideal made him shiver with self-aversion.
He stifled a moan&mdash;or tried to and did not succeed,
for it reached Trevison&#8217;s ears and he turned quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you call, Judge?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; whispered the Judge, hoarsely. &#8220;I
want&mdash;to tell you everything! I have longed to tell
you all along!&#8221;</p>
<p>An hour later they were sitting on the edge of the
ledge, their feet dangling, the abyss below them, the
desert stars twinkling coldly above them; around them
the indescribable solitude of a desert night filled with
mystery, its vague, haunting, whispering voice burdened
with its age-old secrets. Trevison had an arm around
the Judge&#8217;s shoulder. Their voices mingled&mdash;the
Judge&#8217;s low, quavering; Trevison&#8217;s full, deep, sympathetic.</p>
<p>After a while a rider appeared out of the starlit
haze of the plains below them. The Judge started.
Trevison laughed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Clay Levins, Judge. I&#8217;ve been watching him
for half an hour. He&#8217;ll stay here with you while I
go after the record. Under the bottom drawer, eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Levins hallooed to them. Trevison answered, and
he and the Judge walked forward to meet Levins at
the crest of the slope.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slicker&#8217;n a whistle!&#8221; declared Levins, answering
the question Trevison put to him. &#8220;I mailed the damn
letter an&#8217; come back on the train that brought it to
him!&#8221; He grinned felinely at the Judge. &#8220;I reckon
you&#8217;re a heap dry an&#8217; hungry by this time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Judge has feasted,&#8221; said Trevison. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going after the record. You&#8217;re to stay here with the
Judge until I return. Then the three of us will ride
to Las Vegas, where we will take a train to Santa Fe,
to turn the record over to the Circuit Court.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds good!&#8221; gloated Levins. &#8220;But it&#8217;s too long
around. I&#8217;m for somethin&#8217; more direct. Why not take
the Judge with you to Manti, get the record, takin&#8217; a
bunch of your boys with you&mdash;an&#8217; salivate that damned
Corrigan an&#8217; his deputies!&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevison laughed softly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want any violence
if I can avoid it. My land won&#8217;t run away while
we&#8217;re in Santa Fe. And the Judge doesn&#8217;t want to meet
Corrigan just now. I don&#8217;t know that I blame him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the record?&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevison told him, and Levins grumbled. &#8220;Corrigan&#8217;ll
have his deputies guardin&#8217; the courthouse, most
likely. If you run ag&#8217;in &#8217;em, they&#8217;ll bore you, sure as
hell!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of myself&mdash;I promise you that!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
he laughed, and the Judge shuddered at the sound. He
vanished into the darkness of the ledge, returning presently
with Nigger, led him down the slope, called a
low &#8220;So-long&#8221; to the two watchers on the ledge, and
rode away into the haze of the plains.</p>
<p>Trevison rode fast, filled with a grim elation. He
pitied the Judge. An error&mdash;a momentary weakening
of moral courage&mdash;had plunged the jurist into
the clutches of Corrigan; he could hardly be held responsible
for what had transpired&mdash;he was a puppet in the
hands of an unscrupulous schemer, with a threat of
exposure hanging over him. No wonder he feared
Corrigan! Trevison&#8217;s thoughts grew bitter as they
dwelt upon the big man; the old longing to come into
violent physical contact with the other seized him, raged
within him, brought a harsh laugh to his lips as he rode.
But a greater passion than he felt for the Judge or
Corrigan tugged at him as he urged the big black over
the plains toward the twinkling lights of Manti&mdash;a
fierce exultation which centered around Rosalind Benham.
She had duped him, betrayed him to his enemy,
had played with him&mdash;but she had lost!</p>
<p>Yet the thought of his coming victory over her was
poignantly unsatisfying. He tried to picture her&mdash;did
picture her&mdash;receiving the news of Corrigan&#8217;s defeat,
and somehow it left him with a feeling of regret. The
vengeful delight that he should have felt was absent&mdash;he
felt sorry for her. He charged himself with being
a fool for yielding to so strange a sentiment, but it
lingered persistently. It fed his rage against Corrigan,
however, doubled it, for upon him lay the blame.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>It was late when he reached the outskirts of Manti.
He halted Nigger in the shadow of a shed a hundred
yards or so down the track from the courthouse, dismounted
and made his way cautiously down the railroad
tracks. He was beyond the radius of the lights
from various windows that he passed, but he moved
stealthily, not knowing whether Corrigan had stationed
guards about the courthouse, as Levins had warned.
An instant after reaching a point opposite the courthouse
he congratulated himself on his discretion, for he
caught a glimmer of light at the edge of a window shade
in the courthouse, saw several indistinct figures congregated
at the side door, outside. He slipped behind
a tool shed at the side of the track, and crouching there,
watched and listened. A mumbling of voices reached
him, but he could distinguish no word. But it was
evident that the men outside were awaiting the reappearance
of one of their number who had gone into
the building.</p>
<p>Trevison watched, impatiently. Then presently the
side door opened, letting out a flood of light, which
bathed the figures of the waiting men. Trevison
scowled, for he recognized them as Corrigan&#8217;s deputies.
But he was not surprised, for he had half expected
them to be hanging around the building. Two figures
stepped down from the door as he watched, and he
knew them for Corrigan and Gieger. Corrigan&#8217;s voice
reached him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lock on this door is broken. I had to kick it
in this morning. One of you stay inside, here. The
rest of you scatter and keep your eyes peeled. There&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
trickery afoot. Judge Lindman didn&#8217;t go to Dry Bottom&mdash;the
agent says he&#8217;s sure of that because he saw
every man that&#8217;s got aboard a train here within the
last twenty-four hours&mdash;and Judge Lindman wasn&#8217;t
among them! Levins was, though; he left on the one-thirty
this morning and got back on the six-o&#8217;clock,
tonight.&#8221; He vanished into the darkness beyond the
door, but called back: &#8220;I&#8217;ll be within call. Don&#8217;t
be afraid to shoot if you see anything suspicious!&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevison saw a man enter the building, and the
light was blotted out by the closing of the door. When
his eyes were again accustomed to the darkness he
observed that the men were standing close together&mdash;they
seemed to be holding a conference. Then the
group split up, three going toward the front of the
building; two remaining near the side door, and two
others walking around to the rear.</p>
<p>For an instant Trevison regretted that he had not
taken Levins&#8217; advice about forming a posse of his
own men to take the courthouse by storm, and he
debated the thought of postponing action. But there
was no telling what might happen during an interval
of delay. In his rage over the discovery of the trick
that had been played on him Corrigan might tear the
interior of the building to pieces. He would be sure
to if he suspected the presence of the original record.
Trevison did not go for the help that would have been
very welcome. Instead, he spent some time twirling
the cylinder of his pistol.</p>
<p>He grew tired of crouching after a time and lay
flat on his stomach in the shadow of the tool shed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
watching the men as they tramped back and forth,
around the building. He knew that sooner or later
there would be a minute or two of relaxation, and of
this he had determined to take advantage. But it was
not until sound in the town had perceptibly decreased
in volume that there was any sign of the men relaxing
their vigil. And then he noted them congregating
at the front of the building.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell,&#8221; he heard one of them say; &#8220;what&#8217;s the
use of hittin&#8217; that trail <i>all</i> night! Bill&#8217;s inside, an&#8217; we
can see the door from here. I&#8217;m due for a smoke an&#8217;
a palaver!&#8221; Matches flared up; the sounds of their
voices reached Trevison.</p>
<p>Trevison disappointedly relaxed. Then, filled with
a sudden decision, he slipped around the back of the
tool shed and stole toward the rear of the courthouse.
It projected beyond the rear of the bank building,
adjoining it, forming an L, into the shadow of which
Trevison slipped. He stood there for an instant, breathing
rapidly, undecided. The darkness in the shadow
was intense, and he was forced to feel his way along
the wall for fear of stumbling. He was leaning heavily
on his hands, trusting to them rather than to his
footing, when the wall seemed to give way under them
and he fell forward, striking on his hands and knees.
Fortunately, he had made no sound in falling, and he
remained in the kneeling position until he got an idea
of what had happened. He had fallen across the
threshold of a doorway. The door had been unfastened
and the pressure of his hands had forced it inward.
It was the rear door of the bank building. He looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
inward, wondering at Braman&#8217;s carelessness&mdash;and
stared fixedly straight into a beam of light that shone
through a wedge-shaped crevice between two boards
in the partition that separated the buildings.</p>
<p>He got up silently, stepped stealthily into the room,
closing the door behind him. He tried to fasten it
and discovered that the lock was broken. For some
time he stood, wondering, and then, giving it up, he
made his way cautiously around the room, searching
for Braman&#8217;s cot. He found that, too, empty, and he
decided that some one had broken into the building
during Braman&#8217;s absence. Moving away from the cot,
he stumbled against something soft and yielding, and
his pistol flashed into his hand in sinister preparation,
for he knew from the feel of the soft object that it
was a body, and he suspected that it was Braman, stalking
him. He thought that until he remembered the
broken lock, on the door, and then the significance of
it burst upon him. Whoever had broken the lock had
fixed Braman. He knelt swiftly and ran his hands
over the prone form, drawing back at last with the low
ejaculation: &#8220;He&#8217;s a goner!&#8221; He had no time or
inclination to speculate over the manner of Braman&#8217;s
death, and made catlike progress toward the crevice in
the partition. Reaching it, he dropped on his hands
and knees and peered through. A wooden box on the
other side of the partition intervened, but above it he
could see the form of the deputy. The man was
stretched out in a chair, sideways to the crevice in the
wall, sleeping. A grin of huge satisfaction spread over
Trevison&#8217;s face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>His movements were very deliberate and cautious.
But in a quarter of an hour he had pulled the board
out until an opening was made in the partition, and
then propping the board back with a chair he reached
through and slowly shoved the box on the other side
back far enough to admit his body. Crawling through,
he rose on the other side, crossed the floor carefully,
kneeled at the drawer where Judge Lindman had concealed
the record, pulled it out and stuck it in the waistband
of his trousers, in front, his eyes glittering with
exultation. Then he began to back toward the opening
in the partition. At the instant he was preparing
to stoop to crawl back into the bank building, the deputy
in the chair yawned, stretched and opened his eyes,
staring stupidly at him. There was no mistaking the
dancing glitter in Trevison&#8217;s eyes, no possible misinterpretation
of his tense, throaty whisper: &#8220;One chirp
and you&#8217;re a dead one!&#8221; And the deputy stiffened in
the chair, dumb with astonishment and terror.</p>
<p>The deputy had not seen the opening in the partition,
for it was partly hidden from his view by the box
which Trevison had encountered in entering, and before
the man had an opportunity to look toward the place,
Trevison commanded him again, in a sharp, cold whisper:</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up and turn your back to me&mdash;quick! Any
noise and I&#8217;ll plug you! Move!&#8221;</p>
<p>The deputy obeyed. Then he received an order to
walk to the door without looking back. He readied
the door&mdash;halted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now open it and get out!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>The man did as bidden; diving headlong out into
the darkness, swinging the door shut behind him. His
yell to his companions mingled with the roar of Trevison&#8217;s
pistol as he shattered the kerosene lamp. The
bullet hit the neck of the glass bowl, a trifle below the
burner, the latter describing a parabola in the air and
falling into the ruin of the bowl. The chimney crashed,
the flame from the wick touched the oil and flared up
brilliantly.</p>
<p>Trevison was half way through the wall by the time
the oil ignited, and he grinned coldly at the sight. Haste
was important now. He slipped through the opening,
pulled the chair from between the board and wall,
letting the board snap back, and placing the chair
against it. He felt certain that the deputies would
think that in some manner he had run their barricade
and entered the building through the door.</p>
<p>He heard voices outside, a fusillade of shots, the
tinkle of breaking glass; against the pine boards at his
side came the wicked thud of bullets, the splintering of
wood as they tore through the partition and embedded
themselves in the outside wall. He ducked low and ran
to the rear door, swinging it open. Braman&#8217;s body
bothered him; he could not leave it there, knowing the
building would soon be in flames. He dragged the
body outside, to a point several feet distant from the
building, dropping it at last and standing erect for the
first time to fill his lungs and look about him. Looking
back as he ran down the tracks toward the shed where
he had left Nigger, he saw shadowy forms of men
running around the courthouse, which was now dully
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
illuminated, the light from within dancing fitfully
through the window shades. Flaming streaks rent the
night from various points&mdash;thinking him still in the
building the deputies were shooting through the windows.
Manti, rudely awakened, was pouring its population
through its doors in streams. Shouts, hoarse,
inquisitive, drifted to Trevison&#8217;s ears. Lights blazed
up, flickering from windows like giant fireflies. Doors
slammed, dogs were barking, men were running. Trevison
laughed vibrantly as he ran. But his lips closed
tightly when he saw two or three shadowy figures darting
toward him, coming from various directions&mdash;one
from across the street; another coming straight down
the railroad track, still another advancing from his
right. He bowed his head and essayed to pass the first
figure. It reached out a hand and grasped his shoulder,
arresting his flight.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let go, you damned fool!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man still clung to him. Trevison wrenched
himself free and struck, viciously. The man dropped
with a startled cry. Another figure was upon Trevison.
He wanted no more trouble at that minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell to pay!&#8221; he panted as the second man loomed
close to him in the darkness; &#8220;Trevison&#8217;s in the courthouse!&#8221;</p>
<p>He heard the other gasp; saw him lunge forward.
He struck again, bitterly, and the man went to his
knees. He was up again instantly, as Trevison fled into
the darkness, crying resonantly:</p>
<p>&#8220;This way, boys&mdash;here he is!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Corrigan!&#8221; breathed Trevison. He ducked as a
flame-spurt split the night; reaching a corner of the
shed where he had left his horse as a succession of
reports rattled behind him. Corrigan was firing at him.
He dared not use his own pistol, lest its flash reveal his
whereabouts, and he knew he would have no chance
against the odds that were against him. Nor was he
intent on murder. He flung himself into the saddle,
and for the first time since he had come into Trevison&#8217;s
possession Nigger knew the bite of spurs earnestly
applied. He snorted, leaped, and plunged forward,
the clatter of his hoofs bringing lancelike streaks of
fire out of the surrounding blackness. Behind him
Trevison heard Corrigan raging impotently, profanely.
There came another scattering volley. Trevison reeled,
caught himself, and then hung hard to the saddle-horn,
as Nigger fled into the night, running as a coyote runs
from the daylight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>ANOTHER WOMAN LIES</h3>
</div>

<p>Shortly before midnight Aunt Agatha Benham
laid her book down, took off her glasses, wiped
her eyes and yawned. She sat for a time stretched out
in her chair, her hands folded in her lap, meditatively
looking at the flicker of the kerosene lamp, thinking
of the conveniences she had given up in order to chaperon
a wilful girl who did not appreciate her services.
It was the selfishness of youth, she decided&mdash;nothing
less. But still Rosalind might understand what a sacrifice
her aunt was making for her. Thrilling with self-pity,
she got up, blew out the light and ascended the
stairs to her room. She plumped herself in a chair
at one of the front windows before beginning to
undress, that she might again feel the delicious thrill,
for that was the only consolation she got from a contemplation
of her sacrifice, Rosalind never offered her
a word of gratitude!</p>
<p>The thrill she anticipated was not the one she experienced&mdash;it
was a thrill of apprehension that seized her&mdash;for
a glowing midnight sky met her gaze as she
stared in the direction of Manti, vast, extensive. In
its center, directly over the town, was a fierce white
glare with off-shoots of licking, leaping tongues of
flame that reached skyward hungrily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<p>Agatha watched for one startled instant, and then
she was in Rosalind&#8217;s room, leaning over the bed, shaking
her. The girl got up, dressed in her night clothes,
and together they stood at one of the windows in the
girl&#8217;s room, watching.</p>
<p>The fierce white center of the fire seemed to expand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fire&mdash;in Manti!&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;See!
Another building has caught! Oh, I <i>do</i> hope they
can put it out!&#8221;</p>
<p>They stood long at the window. Once, when the
glow grew more brilliant, the girl exclaimed sharply,
but after a time the light began to fade, and she drew
a breath of relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have it under control,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, come to bed,&#8221; advised Agatha.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; said the girl. She pressed her face against
the window and peered intently into the darkness. Then
she threw up the sash, stuck her head out and listened.
She drew back, her face slowly whitening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one is coming, Aunty&mdash;and riding very
fast!&#8221;</p>
<p>A premonition of tragedy, associated with the fire,
had seized the girl at her first glimpse of the light,
though she had said nothing. The appearance of a
rider, approaching the house at breakneck speed had
added strength to her fears, and now, driven by the
urge of apprehension that had seized her she flitted out
of the room before Agatha could restrain her, and was
down in the sitting-room in an instant, applying a match
to the lamp. As the light flared up she heard the thunder
of hoofs just outside the door, and she ran to it,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
throwing it open. She shrank back, drawing her breath
gaspingly, for the rider had dismounted and stepped
toward her, into the dim light of the open doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>A low laugh was her answer, and Trevison stepped
over the threshold and closed the door behind him.
From the foot of the stairs Agatha saw him, and she
stood, nerveless and shaking with dread over the picture
he made.</p>
<p>He had been more than forty-eight hours without
sleep, the storm-center of action had left its impression
on him, and his face was gaunt and haggard, with
great, dark hollows under his eyes. The three or four
days&#8217; growth of beard accentuated the bold lines of his
chin and jaw; his eyes were dancing with the fires of
passion; he held a Winchester rifle under his right
arm, the left, hanging limply at his side, was stained
darkly. He swayed as he stood looking at the girl,
and smiled with faint derision at the naked fear and
wonder that had leaped into her eyes. But the derision
was tinged with bitterness, for this girl with both hands
pressed over her breast, heaving with the mingled emotions
of modesty and dismay, was one of the chief factors
in the scheme to rob him. The knowledge hurt
him worse than the bullet which had passed through
his arm. She had been uppermost in his thoughts during
his reckless ride from Manti, and he would have
cheerfully given his land, his ten years of labor, for the
assurance that she was innocent. But he knew guilt
when he saw it, and proof of it had been in her avoidance
of him, in her ride to save Corrigan&#8217;s mining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
machinery, in her subsequent telling of his presence
at the butte on the night of the dynamiting, in her
bitter declaration that he ought to be punished for it.
The case against her was strong. And yet on his ride
from Manti he had been irresistibly drawn toward the
Bar B ranchhouse. He had told himself as he rode
that the impulse to visit her this night was strong
within him because on his way to the pueblo he was
forced to pass the house, but he knew better&mdash;he had
lied to himself. He wanted to talk with her again; he
wanted to show her the land record, which proved her
fiance&#8217;s guilt; he wanted to watch her as she looked
at the record, to learn from her face&mdash;what he might
find there.</p>
<p>He stood the rifle against the wall near the door,
while the girl and her aunt watched him, breathlessly.
His voice was vibrant and hoarse, but well under control,
and he smiled with straight lips as he set the rifle
down and drew the record from his waistband.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve something to show you, Miss Benham. I
couldn&#8217;t pass the house without letting you know what
has happened.&#8221; He opened the book and stepped to
her side, swinging his left hand up, the index finger
indicating a page on which his name appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; he said, sharply, and watched her face
closely. He saw her cheeks blanch, and set his lips
grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she said, after she had hurriedly scanned
the page; &#8220;it seems to prove your title! But this is a
court record, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; She examined the gilt lettering
on the back of the volume, and looked up at him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
with wide, luminous eyes. &#8220;Where did you get that
book?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From the courthouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I thought people weren&#8217;t permitted to take
court records&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve taken this one,&#8221; he laughed.</p>
<p>She looked at the blood on his hand, shudderingly.
&#8220;Why,&#8221; she said; &#8220;there&#8217;s been violence! The fire,
the blood on your hand, the record, your ride here&mdash;What
does it mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It means that I&#8217;ve been denied my rights, and I&#8217;ve
taken them. Is there any crime in that? Look here!&#8221;
He took another step and stood looking down at her.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying anything about Corrigan. You know
what we think of each other, and we&#8217;ll fight it out, man
to man. But the fact that a woman is engaged to one
man doesn&#8217;t bar another man from the game. And
I&#8217;m in this game to the finish. And even if I don&#8217;t get
you I don&#8217;t want you to be mixed up in these schemes
and plots&mdash;you&#8217;re too good a girl for that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; She stiffened, looking scornfully
at him, her chin held high, outraged innocence in
her manner. His cold grin of frank disbelief roused
her to furious indignation. What right had he to question
her integrity to make such speeches to her after his
disgraceful affair with Hester Harvey?</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not care to discuss the matter with you!&#8221; she
said, her lips stiff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ha, ha!&#8221; The bitter derision in his laugh made
her blood riot with hatred. He walked toward the
door and took up the rifle, dimly remembering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
she had used the same words to him once before, when
he had met her as she had been riding toward Manti.
Of course she wouldn&#8217;t discuss such a thing&mdash;he had
been a blind fool to think she would. But it proved her
guilt. Swinging the rifle under his arm, he opened the
door, turned when on the threshold and bowed to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I troubled you, Miss Benham,&#8221; he said.
He essayed to turn, staggered, looked vacantly around
the room, his lips in a queerly cold half-smile, and then
without uttering a sound pitched forward, one shoulder
against the door jamb, and slid slowly to his knees,
where he rested, his head sinking limply to his chest.
He heard the girl cry out sharply and he raised his
head with an effort and smiled reassuringly at her, and
when he felt her hands on his arm, trying to lift him,
he laughed aloud in self-derision and got to his feet,
hanging to the door jamb.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Miss Benham,&#8221; he mumbled. &#8220;I lost
some blood, I suppose. Rotten luck, isn&#8217;t it. I
shouldn&#8217;t have stopped.&#8221; He turned to go, lurched forward
and would have fallen out of the door had not the
girl seized and steadied him.</p>
<p>He did not resist when she dragged him into the
room and closed the door, but he waved her away when
she tried to take his arm and lead him toward the
kitchen where, she insisted, she would prepare a stimulant
and food for him. He tottered after her, tall and
gaunt, his big, lithe figure strangely slack, his head
rocking, the room whirling around him. He had held
to the record and the rifle; the latter by the muzzle,
dragging it after him, the record under his arm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>But his marvelous constitution, a result of his clean
living and outdoor life, responded quickly to the stimulation
of food and hot drinks, and in half an hour
he got up, still a little weak, but with some color
in his cheeks, and shame-facedly thanked the girl. He
realized now, that he should not have come here; the
past few hours loomed in his thoughts like a wild nightmare
in which he had lost his sense of proportion,
yielding to the elemental passions that had been aroused
in his long, sleepless struggle, making him act upon
impulses that he would have frowned contemptuously
away in a normal frame of mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been nearly crazy, I think,&#8221; he said to the
girl with a wan smile of self-accusation. &#8220;I want you
to forget what I said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened at Manti?&#8221; she demanded, ignoring
his words.</p>
<p>He laughed at the recollection, tucking his rifle under
his arm, preparatory to leaving. &#8220;I went after the
record. I got it. There was a fight. But I got away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the fire!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was forced to smash a lamp in the courthouse.
The wick fell into the oil, and I couldn&#8217;t delay to&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was anybody hurt&mdash;besides you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Braman&#8217;s dead.&#8221; The girl gasped and shrank from
him, and he saw that she believed he had killed the
banker, and he was about to deny the crime when
Agatha&#8217;s voice shrilled through the doorway:</p>
<p>&#8220;There are some men coming, Rosalind!&#8221; And
then, vindictively: &#8220;I presume they are desperadoes&mdash;too!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Deputies!&#8221; said Trevison. The girl clasped her
hands over her breast in dismay, which changed to terror
when she saw Trevison stiffen and leap toward the
door. She was afraid for him, horrified over this second
lawless deed, dumb with doubt and indecision&mdash;and
she didn&#8217;t want them to catch him!</p>
<p>He opened the door, paused on the threshold and
smiled at her with straight, hard lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Braman was&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go!&#8221; she cried in a frenzy of anxiety; &#8220;go!&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed mockingly, and looked at her intently.
&#8220;I suppose I will never understand women. You are
my enemy, and yet you give me food and drink and
are eager to have me escape your accomplice. Don&#8217;t
you know that this record will ruin him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go, go!&#8221; she panted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;re a puzzle!&#8221; he said. She saw him
leap into the saddle, and she ran to the lamp, blew out
the flame, and returned to the open door, in which
she stood for a long time, listening to rapid hoof beats
that gradually receded. Before they died out entirely
there came the sound of many others, growing in volume
and drawing nearer, and she beat her hands
together, murmuring:</p>
<p>&#8220;Run, Nigger&mdash;run, run, run!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>She closed the door as the hoof beats sounded in the
yard, locking it and retreating to the foot of the stairs,
where Agatha stood.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it all mean?&#8221; asked the elder woman.
She was trembling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; whispered the girl, gulping
hard to keep her voice from breaking. &#8220;It&#8217;s something
about Trevison&#8217;s land. And I&#8217;m afraid, Aunty,
that there is something terribly wrong. Mr. Corrigan
says it belongs to him, and the court in Manti
has decided in his favor. But according to the record
in Trevison&#8217;s possession, <i>he</i> has a clear title to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there,&#8221; consoled Agatha; &#8220;your father
wouldn&#8217;t permit&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; said the girl, vehemently; &#8220;he wouldn&#8217;t.
But I can&#8217;t understand why Trevison fights so hard if&mdash;if
he is in the wrong!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a desperado, my dear; a wild, reckless spirit
who has no regard for law and order. Of course, if
these men are after him, you will tell them he was
here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said the girl, sharply; &#8220;I shan&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you shouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; acquiesced Agatha. She
patted the girl&#8217;s shoulder. &#8220;Maybe it would be for the
best, dear&mdash;he may be in the right. And I think I
understand why you went riding with him so much,
dear. He may be wild and reckless, but he&#8217;s a man&mdash;every
inch of him!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl squeezed her relative&#8217;s hand and went to
open the door, upon which had come a loud knock.
Corrigan stood framed in the opening. She could
see his face only dimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no occasion for alarm, Miss Benham,&#8221; he
said, and she felt that he could see her better than
she could see him, and thus must have discerned something
of her emotion. &#8220;I must apologize for this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
noisy demonstration. I believe I&#8217;m a
little excited, though. Has Trevison passed here within the last
hour or so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, firmly.</p>
<p>He laughed shortly. &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll get him. I&#8217;ve
split my men up&mdash;some have gone to his ranch, the
others have headed for Levins&#8217; place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough. Judge Lindman disappeared&mdash;the supposition
is that he was abducted. I placed some men
around the courthouse, to safeguard the records, and
Trevison broke in and set fire to the place. He also
robbed the safe in the bank, and killed Braman&mdash;choked
him to death. A most revolting murder. I&#8217;m
sorry I disturbed you&mdash;good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl closed the door as he left it, and leaned
against it, weak and shaking. Corrigan&#8217;s voice had
a curious note in it. He had told her he was sorry
to have disturbed her, but the words had not rung
true&mdash;there had been too much satisfaction in them.
What was she to believe from this night&#8217;s events? One
thought leaped vividly above the others that rioted
in her mind: Trevison had again sinned against the
law, and this time his crime was murder! She shrank
away from the door and joined Agatha at the foot of
the stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunty,&#8221; she sobbed; &#8220;I want to go away. I want
to go back East, away from this lawlessness and confusion!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There, there, dear,&#8221; soothed Agatha. &#8220;I am sure
everything will come out all right. But Trevison <i>does</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
look to be the sort of a man who would abduct a judge,
doesn&#8217;t he? If I were a girl, and felt that he were in
love with me, I&#8217;d be mighty careful&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That he wouldn&#8217;t abduct you?&#8221; laughed the girl,
tremulously, cheered by the change in her relative&#8217;s
manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Agatha, slyly. &#8220;I&#8217;d be mighty careful
that he <i>got</i> me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said the girl, and buried her face in her
aunt&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>IN THE DARK</h3>
</div>

<p>Trevison faced the darkness between him and
the pueblo with a wild hope pulsing through his
veins. Rosalind Benham had had an opportunity to
deliver him into the hands of his enemy and she had
not taken advantage of it. There was but one interpretation
that he might place upon her failure to aid
her accomplice. She declined to take an active part in
the scheme. She had been passive, content to watch
while Corrigan did the real work. Possibly she had
no conception of the enormity of the crime. She had
been eager to have Corrigan win, and influenced by
her affection and his arguments she had done what
she could without actually committing herself to the
robbery. It was a charitable explanation, and had many
flaws, but he clung to it persistently, nurturing it with
his hopes and his hunger for her, building it up until
it became a structure of logic firmly fixed and impregnable.
Women were easily influenced&mdash;that had been
his experience with them&mdash;he was forced to accept
it as a trait of the sex. So he absolved her, his hunger
for her in no way sated at the end.</p>
<p>His thoughts ran to Corrigan in a riot of rage that
pained him like a knife thrust; his lust for vengeance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
was a savage, bitter-visaged demon that held him in
its clutch and made his temples pound with a yearning
to slay. And that, of course, would have to be
the end. For the enmity that lay between them was
not a thing to be settled by the law&mdash;it was a man to
man struggle that could be settled in only one way&mdash;by
the passions, naked, elemental, eternal. He saw it
coming; he leaped to meet it, eagerly.</p>
<p>Every stride the black horse made shortened by that
much the journey he had resolved upon, and Nigger
never ran as he was running now. The black seemed
to feel that he was on the last lap of a race that had
lasted for more than forty-eight hours, with short intervals
of rest between, and he did his best without faltering.</p>
<p>Order had come out of the chaos of plot and counterplot;
Trevison&#8217;s course was to be as direct as his hatred.
He would go to the pueblo, take Judge Lindman and
the record to Santa Fe, and then return to Manti for
a last meeting with Corrigan.</p>
<p>A late moon, rising from a cleft in some distant
mountains, bathed the plains with a silvery flood when
horse and rider reached a point within a mile of the
pueblo, and Nigger covered the remainder of the distance
at a pace that made the night air drum in Trevison&#8217;s
ears. The big black slowed as he came to a
section of broken country surrounding the ancient city,
but he got through it quickly and skirted the sand
slopes, taking the steep acclivity leading to the ledge
of the pueblo in a dozen catlike leaps and coming to
a halt in the shadow of an adobe house, heaving deeply,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
his rider flung himself out of the saddle and ran along
the ledge to the door of the chamber where he had
imprisoned Judge Lindman.</p>
<p>Trevison could see no sign of the Judge or Levins.
The ledge was bare, aglow, the openings of the communal
houses facing it loomed dark, like the doors of
tombs. A ghastly, unearthly silence greeted Trevison&#8217;s
call after the echoes died away; the upper tier of adobe
boxes seemed to nod in ghostly derision as his gaze
swept them. There was no sound, no movement, except
the regular cough of his own laboring lungs, and the
rustle of his clothing as his chest swelled and deflated
with the effort. He exclaimed impatiently and retraced
his steps, peering into recesses between the communal
houses, certain that the Judge and Levins had fallen
asleep in his absence. He turned at a corner and in
a dark angle almost stumbled over Levins. He was
lying on his stomach, his right arm under his head, his
face turned sideways. Trevison thought at first that
he was asleep and prodded him gently with the toe of
his boot. A groan smote his ears and he kneeled
quickly, turning Levins over. Something damp and
warm met his fingers as he seized the man by the
shoulder, and he drew the hand away quickly, exclaiming
sharply as he noted the stain on it.</p>
<p>His exclamation brought Levins&#8217; eyes open, and he
stared upward, stupidly at first, then with a bright gaze
of comprehension. He struggled and sat up, swaying
from side to side.</p>
<p>&#8220;They got the Judge, &#8216;Brand&#8217;&mdash;they run him off,
with my cayuse!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who got him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t reckonin&#8217; to know. Some of Corrigan&#8217;s
scum, most likely&mdash;I didn&#8217;t see &#8217;em close.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a hell of a while. Mebbe fifteen or twenty
minutes. I been missin&#8217; a lot of time, I reckon. Can&#8217;t
have been long, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way did they go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Off towards Manti. Two of &#8217;em took him. The
rest is layin&#8217; low somewhere, most likely. Watch out
they don&#8217;t get <i>you</i>! I ain&#8217;t seen &#8217;em run off, yet!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did it happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t
got it clear in my head, yet. Just happened,
I reckon. The Judge was settin&#8217;
on the ledge just in
front of the dobie house you had him in. I was moseyin&#8217;
along the edge, tryin&#8217; to figger out what a light
in the sky off towards Manti meant. I couldn&#8217;t figger
it out&mdash;what in hell was it, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The courthouse burned&mdash;maybe the bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>Levins chuckled. &#8220;You got the record, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ve lost the Judge! Ain&#8217;t I a box-head,
though!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right. Go ahead. What happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was moseyin along the ledge. Just when I got
to the slope where we come up&mdash;passin&#8217; it&mdash;I seen a
bunch of guys, on horses, coming out of the shadow
of an angle, down there. I hadn&#8217;t seen &#8217;em before. I
knowed somethin&#8217; was up an&#8217; I turned, to light out
for shelter. An&#8217; just then one of &#8217;em burns me in the
back&mdash;with a rifle bullet. It couldn&#8217;t have been no six,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
from that distance. It took the starch out of me, an&#8217;
I caved, I reckon, for a little while. When I woke up
the Judge was gone. The moon had just come up an&#8217;
I seen him ridin&#8217; away on my cayuse, between two other
guys. I reckon I must have gone off again, when you
shook me.&#8221; He laughed, weakly. &#8220;What gets <i>me</i>,
is where them other guys went, after the two sloped
with the Judge. If they&#8217;d have been hangin&#8217; around
they&#8217;d sure have got <i>you</i>, comin&#8217; up here, wouldn&#8217;t
they?&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevison&#8217;s answer was a hoarse exclamation. He
swung Levins up and bore him into one of the communal
houses, whose opening faced away from the
plains and the activity. Then he ran to where he had
left Nigger, leading the animal back into the zig-zag
passages, pulling his rifle out of the saddle holster and
stationing himself in the shadow of the house in which
he had taken Levins.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve come back, eh?&#8221; the wounded man&#8217;s voice
floated out to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;five or six of them. No&mdash;eight! They&#8217;ve
got sharp eyes, too!&#8221; he added stepping back as a rifle
bullet droned over his head, chipping a chunk of adobe
from the roof of the box in whose shelter he stood.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Sullenly, Corrigan had returned to Manti with the
deputies that had accompanied him to the Bar B. He
had half expected to find Trevison at the ranchhouse,
for he had watched him when he had ridden away and
he seemed to have been headed in that direction. Jealousy
dwelt darkly in the big man&#8217;s heart, and he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
found his reason for the suspicion there. He thought
he knew truth when he saw it, and he would have sworn
that truth shone from Rosalind Benham&#8217;s eyes when
she had told him that she had not seen Trevison pass
that way. He had not known that what he took for
the truth was the cleverest bit of acting the girl had
ever been called upon to do. He had decided that
Trevison had swung off the Bar B trail somewhere
between Manti and the ranchhouse, and he led his deputies
back to town, content to permit his men to continue
the search for Trevison, for he was convinced
that the latter&#8217;s visit to the courthouse had resulted
in disappointment, for he had faith in Judge Lindman&#8217;s
declaration that he had destroyed the record. He had
accused himself many times for his lack of caution in
not being present when the record had been destroyed,
but regrets had become impotent and futile.</p>
<p>Reaching Manti, he dispersed his deputies and
sought his bed in the <i>Castle</i>. He had not been in bed
more than an hour when an attendant of the hotel
called to him through the door that a man named Gieger
wanted to talk with him, below. He dressed and went
down to the street, to find Gieger and another deputy
sitting on their horses in front of the hotel with Judge
Lindman, drooping from his long vigil, between
them.</p>
<p>Corrigan grinned scornfully at the Judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clever, eh?&#8221; he sneered. He spoke softly, for the
dawn was not far away, and he knew that a voice
carries resonantly at that hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand you!&#8221; Judicial dignity sat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
sadly on the Judge; he was tired and haggard, and his
voice was a weak treble. &#8220;If you mean&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you what I mean.&#8221; Corrigan motioned
to the deputies. &#8220;Bring him along!&#8221; Leading the
way he took them through Manti&#8217;s back door across a
railroad spur to a shanty beside the track which the
engineer in charge of the dam occasionally occupied
when his duty compelled him to check up arriving material
and supplies. Because plans and other valuable
papers were sometimes left in the shed it was stoutly
built, covered with corrugated iron, and the windows
barred with iron, prison-like. Reaching the shed, Corrigan
unlocked the door, shoved the Judge inside, closed
the door on the Judge&#8217;s indignant protests, questioned
the deputies briefly, gave them orders and then re-entered
the shed, closing the door behind him.</p>
<p>He towered over the Judge, who had sunk weakly
to a bench. It was pitch dark in the shed, but Corrigan
had seen the Judge drop on the bench and knew
exactly where he was.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want the whole story&mdash;without any reservations,&#8221;
said Corrigan, hoarsely; &#8220;and I want it quick&mdash;as
fast as you can talk!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge got up, resenting the other&#8217;s tone. He
had also a half-formed resolution to assert his independence,
for he had received certain assurances from Trevison
with regard to his past which had impressed him&mdash;and
still impressed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I refuse to be questioned by you, sir&mdash;especially
in this manner! I do not purpose to take further&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Judge felt Corrigan&#8217;s fingers at his throat, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
gasped with horror, throwing up his hands to ward
them off, failed, and heard Corrigan&#8217;s laugh as the
fingers gripped his throat and held.</p>
<p>When the Judge came to, it was with an excruciatingly
painful struggle that left him shrinking and nerveless,
lying in a corner, blinking at the light of a kerosene
lamp. Corrigan sat on the edge of a flat-topped
desk watching him with an ugly, appraising, speculative
grin. It was as though the man were mentally gambling
on his chances to recover from the throttling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said when the Judge at last struggled
and sat up; &#8220;how do you like it? You&#8217;ll get more if
you don&#8217;t talk fast and straight! Who wrote that letter,
from Dry Bottom?&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither judicial dignity or resolutions of independence
could resist the threatened danger of further
violence that shone from Corrigan&#8217;s eyes, and the Judge
whispered gaspingly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Trevison.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so! Now, be careful how you answer
this. What did Trevison want in the courthouse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The original record of the land transfers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did he get it?&#8221; Corrigan&#8217;s voice was dangerously
even, and the Judge squirmed and coughed before he
spoke the hesitating word that was an admission of
his deception:</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him&mdash;where&mdash;it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paralyzed with fear, the Judge watched Corrigan
slip off the desk and approach him. He got to his
feet and raised his hands to shield his throat as the big
man stopped in front of him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, Corrigan&mdash;don&#8217;t, for God&#8217;s sake!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; said the big man. He struck, venomously.
An instant later he put out the light and stepped down
into the gray dawn, locking the door of the shanty
behind him and not looking back.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>THE ASHES</h3>
</div>

<p>Rosalind Benham got up with the dawn and
looked out of a window toward Manti. She had
not slept. She stood at the window for some time and
then returned to the bed and sat on its edge, staring
thoughtfully downward. She could not get Trevison
out of her mind. It seemed to her that a crisis
had come and that it was imperative for her to reach
a decision&mdash;to pronounce judgment. She was trying
to do this calmly; she was trying to keep sentiment from
prejudicing her. She found it difficult when considering
Trevison, but when she arrayed Hester Harvey
against her longing for the man she found that her
scorn helped her to achieve a mental balance that permitted
her to think of him almost dispassionately. She
became a mere onlooker, with a calm, clear vision. In
this rôle she weighed him. His deeds, his manner, his
claims, she arrayed against Corrigan and his counter-claims
and ambitions, and was surprised to discover
that were she to be called upon to pass judgment on
the basis of this surface evidence she would have decided
in favor of Trevison. She had fought against that,
for it was a tacit admission that her father was in some
way connected with Corrigan&#8217;s scheme, but she admitted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
it finally, with a pulse of repugnance, and when she
placed Levins&#8217; story on the mental balance, with the
knowledge that she had seen the record which seemed
to prove the contention of fraud in the land transaction,
the evidence favored Trevison overwhelmingly.</p>
<p>She got up and began to dress, her lips set with determination.
Corrigan had held her off once with plausible
explanations, but she would not permit him to do
so again. She intended to place the matter before her
father. Justice must be done. Before she had half
finished dressing she heard a rustle and turned to see
Agatha standing in the doorway connecting their rooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stand the suspense any longer, Aunty. There
is something very wrong about that land business. I
am going to telegraph to father about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going to ask you to do that, dear. It seems
to me that that young Trevison is too much in earnest
to be fighting for something that does not belong to
him. If ever there was honesty in a man&#8217;s face it was
in his face last night. I don&#8217;t believe for a minute
that your father is concerned in Corrigan&#8217;s schemes&mdash;if
there are schemes. But it won&#8217;t do any harm to
learn what your father thinks about it. My dear&mdash;&#8221;
she stepped to the girl and placed an arm around her
waist &#8220;&mdash;last night as I watched Trevison, he reminded
me of a&mdash;a very dear friend that I once knew. I
saw the wreck of my own romance, my dear. He was
just such a man as Trevison&mdash;reckless, impulsive, and
impetuous&mdash;dare-devil who would not tolerate injustice
or oppression. They wouldn&#8217;t let me have him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
my dear, and I never would have another man. He
went away, joined the army, and was killed at the battle
of Kenesaw Mountain. I have kept his memory fresh
in my heart, and last night when I looked at Trevison
it seemed to me that he must be the reincarnation of
the only man I ever loved. There must be something
terribly wrong to make him act the way he does, my
dear. And he loves you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl bit her lips to repress the swelling emotions
which clamored in wild response to this sympathetic
understanding. She looked at Agatha, to see tears in
her eyes, and she wheeled impulsively and threw her
arms around the other&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know exactly how you feel, Aunty. But&mdash;&#8221;
she gulped &#8220;&mdash;he doesn&#8217;t love me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw it in his eyes, my dear.&#8221; Agatha&#8217;s smile
was tender and reminiscent. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry. He
will find a way to let you know&mdash;as he will find a way
to beat Corrigan&mdash;if Corrigan is trying to defraud
him! He&#8217;s that kind, my dear!&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of her aunt&#8217;s assurances the girl&#8217;s heart was
heavy as she began her ride to Manti. Trevison might
love her,&mdash;she had read that it was possible for a
man to love two women&mdash;but she could never return
his love, knowing of his affair with Hester. He should
have justice, however, if they were trying to defraud
him of his rights!</p>
<p>Long before she reached Manti she saw the train
from Dry Bottom, due at Manti at six o&#8217;clock, gliding
over the plains toward the town, and when she arrived
at the station its passengers had been swallowed by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
Manti&#8217;s buildings and the station agent and an assistant
were dragging and bumping trunks and boxes over the
station platform.</p>
<p>The agent bowed deferentially to her and followed
her into the telegraph room, clicking her message over
the wires as soon as she had written it. When he had
finished he wheeled his chair and grinned at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;See the courthouse and the bank?&#8221;</p>
<p>She had&mdash;all that was left of them&mdash;black, charred
ruins with two iron safes, red from their baptism of
fire, standing among them. Also two other buildings,
one on each side of the two that had been destroyed,
scorched and warped, but otherwise undamaged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come pretty near burning the whole town. It took
<i>some</i> work to confine <i>that</i> fire&mdash;coal oil. Trevison
did a clean job. Robbed the safe in the bank. Killed
Braman&mdash;guzzled him. An awful complete job, from
Trevison&#8217;s viewpoint. The town&#8217;s riled, and I wouldn&#8217;t
give a plugged cent for Trevison&#8217;s chances. He&#8217;s
sloped. Desperate character&mdash;I always thought he&#8217;d
rip things loose&mdash;give him time. It was him blowed
up Corrigan&#8217;s mine. I ain&#8217;t seen Corrigan since last
night, but I heard him and twenty or thirty deputies
are on Trevison&#8217;s trail. I hope they get him.&#8221; He
squinted at her. &#8220;There&#8217;s trouble brewing in this town,
Miss Benham. I wouldn&#8217;t advise you to stay here any
longer than is <i>absolutely</i> necessary. There&#8217;s two factions&mdash;looks
like. It&#8217;s about that land deal. Lefingwell
and some more of them think they&#8217;ve been given
a raw decision by the court and Corrigan. Excitement!
Oh, Lord! This town is fierce. I ain&#8217;t had any sleep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
in&mdash;Your answer? I can&#8217;t tell. Mebbe right away.
Mebbe in an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosalind went out upon the platform. The agent&#8217;s
words had revived a horror that she had almost forgotten&mdash;that
she wanted to forget&mdash;the murder of
Braman.</p>
<p>She walked to the edge of the station platform, tortured
by thoughts in which she could find no excuse
for Trevison. Murderer and robber! A fugitive from
justice&mdash;the very justice he had been demanding! Her
thoughts made her weak and sick, and she stepped
down from the platform and walked up the track,
halting beside a shed and leaning against it. Across
the street from her was the <i>Castle</i> hotel. A man in
boots, corduroy trousers, and a flannel shirt and dirty
white apron, his sleeves rolled to the elbows, was washing
the front windows and spitting streams of tobacco
juice on the board walk. She shivered. A grocer next
to the hotel was adjusting a swinging shelf affixed to
the store-front, preparatory to piling his wares upon
it; a lean-faced man standing in a doorway in the building
adjoining the grocery was inspecting a six-shooter
that he had removed from the holster at his side. Rosalind
shivered again. Civilization and outlawry were
strangely mingled here. She would not have been surprised
to see the lean-faced man begin to shoot at the
others. Filled with sudden trepidation she took a step
away from the shed, intending to return to the station
and wait for her answer.</p>
<p>As she moved she heard a low moan. She started,
paling, and then stood stock still, trembling with dread,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
but determined not to run. The sound came again,
seeming to issue from the interior of the shed, and
she retraced her step and leaned again against the
wall of the building, listening.</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the sound&mdash;someone was
in trouble. But she wanted to be certain before calling
for help and she listened again to hear an unmistakable
pounding on the wall near her, and a voice,
calling frenziedly: &#8220;Help, help&mdash;for God&#8217;s sake!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her fears fled and she sprang to the door, finding
it locked. She rattled it, impotently, and then left it
and ran across the street to where the window-washer
stood. He wheeled and spat copiously, almost in her
face, as she rapidly told him her news, and then deliberately
dropped his brush and cloth into the dust and
mud at his feet and jumped after her, across the street.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s in here?&#8221; demanded the man, hammering
on the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s I&mdash;Judge Lindman! Open the door! Hurry!
I&#8217;m smothering&mdash;and hurt!&#8221;</p>
<p>In what transpired within the next few minutes&mdash;and
indeed during the hours following&mdash;the girl felt
like an outsider. No one paid any attention to her;
she was shoved, jostled, buffeted, by the crowd that
gathered, swarming from all directions. But she was
intensely interested.</p>
<p>It seemed to her that every person in Manti gathered
in front of the shed&mdash;that all had heard of the
abduction of the Judge. Some one secured an iron
bar and battered the lock off the door; a half-dozen
men dragged the Judge out, and he stood in front of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
the building, swaying in the hands of his supporters,
his white hair disheveled, his lips blood-stained and
smashed, where Corrigan had hit him. The frenzy of
terror held him, and he looked wildly around at the tiers
of faces confronting him, the cords of his neck standing
out and writhing spasmodically. Twice he opened
his lips to speak, but each time his words died in a dry
gasp. At the third effort he shrieked:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I want protection! Don&#8217;t let him touch me
again, men! He means to kill me! Don&#8217;t let him
touch me! I&mdash;I&#8217;ve been attacked&mdash;choked&mdash;knocked
insensible! I appeal to you as American citizens for
protection!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was fear, stark, naked, cringing, that the crowd
saw. Faces blanched, bodies stiffened; a concerted
breath, like a sigh, rose into the flat, desert air. Rosalind
clenched her hands and stood rigid, thrilling with
pity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who done it?&#8221; A dozen voices asked the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Corrigan!&#8221; The Judge screamed this, hysterically.
&#8220;He is a thief and a scoundrel, men! He has plundered
this county! He has prostituted your court. Your
judge, too! I admit it. But I ask your mercy, men!
I was forced into it! He threatened me! He falsified
the land records! He wanted me to destroy the original
record, but I didn&#8217;t&mdash;I told Trevison where it was&mdash;I
hid it! And because I wouldn&#8217;t help Corrigan to
rob you, he tried to kill me!&#8221;</p>
<p>A murmur, low, guttural, vindictive, rippled over
the crowd, which had now swelled to such proportions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
that the street could not hold it. It fringed the railroad
track; men were packed against the buildings surrounding
the shed; they shoved, jostled and squirmed
in an effort to get closer to the Judge. The windows
of the <i>Castle</i> hotel were filled with faces, among which
Rosalind saw Hester Harvey&#8217;s, ashen, her eyes aglow.</p>
<p>The Judge&#8217;s words had stabbed Rosalind&mdash;each
like a separate knife-thrust; they had plunged her into
a mental vacuum in which her brain, atrophied, reeled,
paralyzed. She staggered&mdash;a man caught her, muttered
something about there being too much excitement
for a lady, and gruffly ordered others to clear the way
that he might lead her out of the jam. She resisted,
for she was determined to stay to hear the Judge to
the end, and the man grinned hugely at her; and to
escape the glances that she could feel were directed
at her she slipped through the crowd and sought the
front of the shed, leaning against it, weakly.</p>
<p>A silence had followed the murmur that had run
over the crowd. There was a breathless period, during
which every man seemed to be waiting for his neighbor
to take the initiative. They wanted a leader. And he
appeared, presently&mdash;a big, broad-shouldered man
forced his way through the crowd and halted in front
of the Judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ll protect you, Judge. Just spit out
what you got to say. We&#8217;ll stand by you. Where&#8217;s
Trevison?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He came to the courthouse last night to get the
record. I told him where it was. He forced me to go
with him to an Indian pueblo, and he kept me there
yesterday. He left me there last night with Clay
Levins, while he came here to get the record.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you reckon he got it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. But from the way Corrigan acted
last night&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes; he got it!&#8221;</p>
<p>The words shifted the crowd&#8217;s gaze to Rosalind,
swiftly. The girl had hardly realized that she had
spoken. Her senses, paralyzed a minute before, had
received the electric shock of sympathy from a continued
study of the Judge&#8217;s face. She saw remorse on
it, regret, shame, and the birth of a resolution to make
whatever reparation that was within his power, at
whatever cost. It was a weak face, but it was not
vicious, and while she had been standing there she had
noted the lines of suffering. It was not until the
girl felt the gaze of many curious eyes on her that
she realized she had committed herself, and her cheeks
flamed. She set herself to face the stares; she must
go on now.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Benham&#8217;s girl!&#8221; she heard a man standing
near her whisper hoarsely, and she faced them, her
chin held high, a queer joy leaping in her heart. She
knew at this minute that her sympathies had been with
Trevison all along; that she had always suspected Corrigan,
but had fought against the suspicion because of
the thought that in some way her father might be
dragged into the affair. It had been a cowardly attitude,
and she was glad that she had shaken it off. As
her brain, under the spur of the sudden excitement,
resumed its function, her thoughts flitted to the agent&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
babble during the time she had been sending the telegram
to her father. She talked rapidly, her voice
carrying far:</p>
<p>&#8220;Trevison got the record last night. He stopped
at my ranch and showed it to me. I suppose he was
going to the pueblo, expecting to meet Levins and Lindman
there&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By God!&#8221; The big, broad-shouldered man standing
at Judge Lindman&#8217;s side interrupted her. He
turned and faced the crowd. &#8220;We&#8217;re damned fools,
boys&mdash;lettin&#8217; this thing go on like we have! Corrigan&#8217;s
took his deputies out, trailin&#8217; Trevison, chargin&#8217;
him with murderin&#8217; Braman, when his real purpose is
to get his claws on that record! Trevison&#8217;s been fightin&#8217;
our fight for us, an&#8217; we&#8217;ve stood around like a lot of
gillies, lettin&#8217; him do it! It&#8217;s likely that a man who&#8217;d
cook up a deal like the Judge, here, says Corrigan has,
would cook up another, chargin&#8217; Trevison with guzzlin&#8217;
the banker. I&#8217;ve knowed Trevison a long time, boys,
an&#8217; I don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;d <i>guzzle</i> anybody&mdash;he&#8217;s too
square a man for that!&#8221; He stood on his toes, raising
his clenched hands, and bringing them down with
a sweep of furious emphasis.</p>
<p>The crowd swayed restlessly. Rosalind saw it split
apart, men fighting to open a pathway for a woman.
There were shouts of: &#8220;Open up, there!&#8221; &#8220;Let the
lady through!&#8221; &#8220;Gangway!&#8221; &#8220;She&#8217;s got somethin&#8217;
to say!&#8221; And the girl caught her breath sharply, for
she recognized the woman as Hester Harvey.</p>
<p>It was some time before Hester reached the broad-shouldered
man&#8217;s side. There was a stain in each of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
her cheeks, but outwardly, at least, she showed none
of the excitement that had seized the crowd; her movements
were deliberate and there was a resolute set to
her lips. She got through, finally, and halted beside
the big man, the crowd closing up behind her. She
was swallowed in it, lost to sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lift her up, Lefingwell!&#8221; suggested a man on the
outer fringe. &#8220;If she&#8217;s got anything to say, let us all
hear it!&#8221; The suggestion was caught up, insistently.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you ain&#8217;t got no objections, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said the
big man. He stooped at her cold smile and swung her
to his shoulder. She spoke slowly and distinctly, though
there was a tremor in her voice:</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='margin: 0 auto; text-align:center;width: 384px;'>
&#8220;YOU MEN ARE BLIND. CORRIGAN IS A CROOK WHO WILL STOP AT NOTHING.&#8221;<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Trevison did not kill Braman&mdash;it was Corrigan.
Corrigan was in my room in the <i>Castle</i> last night just
after dark. When he left, I watched him from my window,
after putting out the light. He had threatened
to kill Braman. I watched him cross the street and go
around to the rear of the bank building. There was a
light in the rear room of the bank. After a while
Braman and Corrigan entered the banking room. The
light from the rear room shone on them for an instant
and I recognized them. They were at the safe. When
they went out they left the safe door open. After a
while the light went out and I saw Corrigan come from
around the rear of the building, recross the street and
come into the <i>Castle</i>. You men are blind. Corrigan
is a crook who will stop at nothing. If you let him
injure Trevison for a crime that Trevison did not commit
you deserve to be robbed!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lefingwell swung her down from his shoulder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon that cinches it, boys!&#8221; he bellowed over
the heads of the men nearest him. &#8220;There ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217;
plainer! If we stand for this we&#8217;re a bunch of cowardly
coyotes that ain&#8217;t fit to look Trevison in the face!
I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to help him! Who&#8217;s comin&#8217; along?&#8221;</p>
<p>A chorus of shouts drowned his last words; the
crowd was in motion, swift, with definite purpose. It
melted, streaming off in all directions, like the sweep
of water from a bursted dam. It broke at the doors
of the buildings; it sought the stables. Men bearing
rifles appeared in the street, mounting horses and congregating
in front of the <i>Belmont</i>, where Lefingwell
had gone. Other men, on the board sidewalk and in
the dust of the street, were running, shouting, gesticulating.
In an instant the town had become a bedlam
of portentous force; it was the first time in its history
that the people of Manti had looked with collective
vision, and the girl reeled against the iron wall of the
shed, appalled at the resistless power that had been
set in motion. On a night when she sat on the
porch of the Bar B ranchhouse she had looked toward
Manti, thrilled over a pretty mental fancy. She had
thought it all a game&mdash;wondrous, joyous, progressive.
She had neglected to associate justice with it then&mdash;the
inexorable rule of fairness under which every player
of the game must bow. She brought it into use now,
felt the spirit of it, saw the dire tragedy that its perversion
portended, groaned, and covered her face with her
hands.</p>
<p>She looked around after a while. She saw Judge
Lindman walking across the street toward the <i>Castle</i>,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
supported by two other men. A third followed; she
did not know him, but Corrigan would have recognized
him as the hotel clerk who had grown confidential upon
a certain day. The girl heard his voice as he followed
after the Judge and the others&mdash;raucous, vindictive:</p>
<p>&#8220;We need men like Trevison in this town. We can
get along without any Corrigans.&#8221;</p>
<p>She heard a voice behind her and she turned, swiftly,
to see Hester Harvey walking toward her. She would
have avoided the meeting, but she saw that Hester was
intent on speaking and she drew herself erect, bowing
to her with cold courtesy as the woman stopped within
a step of her and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look ready to flop into hysterics, dearie! Won&#8217;t
you come over to my room with me and have something
to brace you up? A cup of tea?&#8221; she added with a
laugh as Rosalind looked quickly at her. She did not
seem to notice the stiffening of the girl&#8217;s body, but
linked her arm within her own and began to walk across
the street. The girl was racked with emotion over the
excitement of the morning, the dread of impending
violence, and half frantic with anxiety over Trevison&#8217;s
safety. Hester&#8217;s offense against her seemed vague
and far, and very insignificant, relatively. She yearned
to exchange confidences with somebody&mdash;anybody, and
this woman, even though she were what she thought
her, had a capacity for feeling, for sympathy. And
she was very, very tired of it all.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was fierce, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Hester a few minutes
later in the privacy of her room, as she balanced her
cup and watched Rosalind as the girl ate, hungrily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
&#8220;These sagebrush rough-necks out here will make Corrigan
hump himself to keep out of their way. But he
deserves it, the crook!&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked curiously at the other, trying hard
to reconcile the vindictiveness of these words and the
woman&#8217;s previous action in giving damaging testimony
against Corrigan, with the significant fact that Corrigan
had been in her room the night before, presumably
as a guest. Hester caught the look and laughed. &#8220;Yes,
dearie, he deserves it. How much do you know of
what has been going on here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very little, I am afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Less than that, I suspect. I happen to know considerable,
and I am going to tell you about it. My trip
out here has been a sort of a wild-goose chase. I
thought I wanted Trevison, but I&#8217;ve discovered I&#8217;m not
badly hurt by his refusal to resume our old relations.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl gasped and almost dropped her cup, setting
it down slowly afterward and staring at her hostess
with doubting, fearing, incredulous eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, dearie,&#8221; laughed the other, with a trace of
embarrassment; &#8220;you can trust your ears on that statement.
To make certain, I&#8217;ll repeat it: I am not very
badly hurt by his refusal to resume our old relations.
Do you know what that means? It means that he
turned me down cold, dearie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean&mdash;&#8221; began the girl, gripping the
table edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean that I lied to you. The night I went over
to Trevison&#8217;s ranch he told me plainly that he didn&#8217;t
like me one teenie, weenie bit any more. He wouldn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
kiss me, shake my hand, or welcome me in any way.
He told me he&#8217;d got over it, the same as he&#8217;d got over
his measles days&mdash;he&#8217;d outgrown it and was going to
throw himself at the feet of another goddess. Oh,
yes, he meant you!&#8221; she laughed, her voice a little too
high, perhaps, with an odd note of bitterness in it.
&#8220;Then, determined to blot my rival out, I lied about
you. I told him that you loved Corrigan and that you
were in the game to rob him of his land. Oh, I
blackened you, dearie! It hurt him, too. For when
a man like Trevison loves a woman&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How could you!&#8221; said the girl, shuddering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t get dramatic,&#8221; jeered the other. &#8220;The
rules that govern the love game are very elastic&mdash;for
some women. I played it strong, but there was no
chance for me from the beginning. Trevison thinks
you are Corrigan&#8217;s trump card in this game. It <i>is</i> a
game, isn&#8217;t it. But he loves you in spite of it all. He
told me he&#8217;d go to the gallows for you. Aren&#8217;t men
the sillies! But just the same, dearie, we women like
to hear them murmur those little heroic things, don&#8217;t
we? It was on the night I told him you&#8217;d told Corrigan
about the dynamiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was my high card,&#8221; laughed the woman,
harshly. &#8220;He took it and derided me. I decided right
then that I wouldn&#8217;t play any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he didn&#8217;t send for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Corrigan did that, dearie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you knew Corrigan before&mdash;before you
came here?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>can</i> guess intelligently, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Corrigan planned it <i>all</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All.&#8221; Hester watched as the girl bowed her head
and sobbed convulsively.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a brazen, crafty and unprincipled <i>thing</i> Trevison
must think me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Hester reached out a hand and laid it on the girl&#8217;s.
&#8220;I&mdash;there was a time when I would have done murder
to have him think of me as he thinks of you, dearie.
He isn&#8217;t for me, though, and I can&#8217;t spoil any woman&#8217;s
happiness. There&#8217;s little enough&mdash;but I&#8217;m not going
to philosophize. I was going away without telling you
this. I don&#8217;t know why I am telling it now. I always
was a little soft. But if you hadn&#8217;t spoken as you did
a while ago in that crowd&mdash;taking Trevison&#8217;s end&mdash;I&mdash;I
think you&#8217;d never have known. Somehow, it
seemed you deserved him, dearie. And I couldn&#8217;t bear
to&mdash;to think of him facing any more disappointment.
He&mdash;he took it so&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked up, to see the woman&#8217;s eyes filling
with a luminous mist. A quick conception of what this
all meant to the woman thrilled the girl. She got up
and walked to the woman&#8217;s side. &#8220;I&#8217;m <i>so</i> sorry, Hester,&#8221;
she said as her arms stole around the other&#8217;s neck.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>She went out a little later, into the glaring, shimmering
sunlight of the morning, her cheeks red, her
eyes aglow, her heart racing wildly, to see an engine
and a luxurious private car just pulling from the main
track to a switch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she whispered, joyously; &#8220;it&#8217;s father&#8217;s!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></p>
<p>And she ran toward it, tingling with a new-found
hope.</p>
<p>In her room at the <i>Castle</i> sat a woman who was
finding the world very empty. It held nothing for her
except the sad consolation of repentance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>THE FIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;The boss is sure a she-wolf at playin&#8217; a lone
hand,&#8221; growled Barkwell, shortly after dusk, to
Jud Weaver, the straw boss. &#8220;Seems he thinks his
friends is delicate ornaments which any use would bust
to smithereens. Here&#8217;s his outfit layin&#8217; around, bitin&#8217;
their finger nails with ongwee an&#8217; pinin&#8217; away to slivers
yearnin&#8217; to get into the big meal-lee, an&#8217; him racin&#8217; an&#8217;
tearin&#8217; around the country fightin&#8217; it out by his lonesome.
I call it rank selfishness!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He sure ought to have give us a chancst to claw the
hair outen that damned Corrigan feller!&#8221; complained
Weaver. &#8220;In some ways, though, I&#8217;m sorta glad the
damned mine was blew up. &#8216;Firebrand&#8217; would have
sure got a-hold of her some day, an&#8217; then we&#8217;d be clawin&#8217;
at the bowels of the earth instid of galivantin&#8217; around
on our cayuses like gentlemen. I reckon things is all
for the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two had come in from the river range ostensibly
to confer with Trevison regarding their work, but in
reality to satisfy their curiosity over Trevison&#8217;s movements.
There was a deep current of concern for him
under their accusations.</p>
<p>They had found the ranchhouse dark and deserted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
But the office door was open and they had entered,
prepared supper, ate with a more than ordinary mingling
of conversation with their food, and not lighting
the lamps had gone out on the gallery for a smoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t done any sleepin&#8217; to amount to much in
the last forty-eight hours, to my knowin&#8217;,&#8221; remarked
Barkwell; &#8220;unless he&#8217;s done his sleepin&#8217; on the run&mdash;an&#8217;
that ain&#8217;t in no ways a comfortable way. He&#8217;s
sure to be driftin&#8217; in here, soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This here country&#8217;s goin&#8217; to hell, certain!&#8221; declared
Weaver, after an hour of silence. &#8220;She&#8217;s gettin&#8217; too
eastern an&#8217; flighty. Railroads an&#8217; dams an&#8217; hotels with
bath tubs for every six or seven rooms, an&#8217; resterawnts
with filleedegree palms an&#8217; leather chairs an&#8217; slick eats
is eatin&#8217; the gizzard outen her. Railroads is all right
in their place&mdash;which is where folks ain&#8217;t got no
cayuses to fork an&#8217; therefore has to hoof it&mdash;or&mdash;or
ride the damn railroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Correct!&#8221; agreed Barkwell; &#8220;she&#8217;s a-goin&#8217; the
way Rome went&mdash;an Babylone&mdash;an&#8217; Cincinnati&mdash;after
I left. She runs to a pussy-cafe aristocracy&mdash;<i>an&#8217;</i>
napkins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll be plumb ruined&mdash;follerin&#8217; them foreign
styles. The Uhmerican people ain&#8217;t got no right to
adopt none of them new-fangled notions.&#8221; Weaver
stared glumly into the darkening plains.</p>
<p>They aired their discontent long. Directed at the
town it relieved the pressure of their resentment over
Trevison&#8217;s habit of depending upon himself. For,
secretly, both were interested admirers of Manti&#8217;s growing
importance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></p>
<p>Time was measured by their desires. Sometime before
midnight Barkwell got up, yawned and stretched.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sleep suits me. If &#8216;Firebrand&#8217; ain&#8217;t reckonin&#8217; on a
guardian, I ain&#8217;t surprisin&#8217; him none. He&#8217;s mighty
close-mouthed about his doin&#8217;s, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re shoutin&#8217;. I ain&#8217;t never seen a man any
stingier about hidin&#8217; away his doin&#8217;s. He just nacherly
hawgs all the trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weaver got up and sauntered to the far end of the
gallery, leaning far out to look toward Manti. His
sharp exclamation brought Barkwell leaping to his side,
and they both watched in perplexity a faint glow in the
sky in the direction of the town. It died down as they
watched.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fire&mdash;looks like,&#8221; Weaver growled. &#8220;We&#8217;re
always too late to horn in on any excitement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh, huh,&#8221; grunted Barkwell. He was staring
intently at the plains, faintly discernable in the starlight.
&#8220;There&#8217;s horses out there, Jud! Three or
four, an&#8217; they&#8217;re comin&#8217; like hell!&#8221;</p>
<p>They slipped off the gallery into the shadow of some
trees, both instinctively feeling of their holsters. Standing
thus they waited.</p>
<p>The faint beat of hoofs came unmistakably to them.
They grew louder, drumming over the hard sand of
the plains, and presently four dark figures loomed out
of the night and came plunging toward the gallery.
They came to a halt at the gallery edge, and were
about to dismount when Barkwell&#8217;s voice, cold and
truculent, issued from the shadow of the trees:</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s eatin&#8217; you guys?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>There was a short, pregnant silence, and then one
of the men laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; He urged his horse forward.
But he was brought to a quick halt when Barkwell&#8217;s
voice came again:</p>
<p>&#8220;Talk from where you are!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That goes,&#8221; laughed the man. &#8220;Trevison here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What you wantin&#8217; of him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty. We&#8217;re deputies. Trevison burned the
courthouse and the bank tonight&mdash;and killed Braman.
We&#8217;re after him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he ain&#8217;t here.&#8221; Barkwell laughed. &#8220;Burned
the courthouse, did he? An&#8217; the bank? An&#8217; killed
Braman? Well, you got to admit that&#8217;s a pretty good
night&#8217;s work. An&#8217; you&#8217;re wantin&#8217; him!&#8221; Barkwell&#8217;s
voice leaped; he spoke in short, snappy, metallic sentences
that betrayed passion long restrained, breaking
his self-control. &#8220;You&#8217;re deputies, eh? Corrigan&#8217;s
whelps! Sneaks! Coyotes! Well, you slope&mdash;you
hear? When I count three, I down you! One! Two!
Three!&#8221;</p>
<p>His six-shooter stabbed the darkness at the last word.
And at his side Weaver&#8217;s pistol barked viciously. But
the deputies had started at the word &#8220;One,&#8221; and though
Barkwell, noting the scurrying of their horses, cut the
final words sharply, the four figures were vague and
shadowy when the first pistol shot smote the air. Not
a report floated back to the ears of the two men. They
watched, with grim pouts on their lips, until the men
vanished in the star haze of the plains. Then Barkwell
spoke, raucously:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve broke in the game, Jud. We&#8217;re Simon-pure
outlaws&mdash;like our boss. I got one of them scum&mdash;I
seen him grab leather. We&#8217;ll all get in, now.
They&#8217;re after our boss, eh? Well, damn &#8217;em, we&#8217;ll
show &#8217;em! They&#8217;s eight of the boys on the south fork.
You get &#8217;em, bring &#8217;em here an&#8217; get rifles. I&#8217;ll hit the
breeze to the basin an&#8217; rustle the others!&#8221; He was
running at the last word, and presently two horses
raced out of the corral gates, clattered past the bunk-house
and were swallowed in the vast, black space.</p>
<p>Half an hour later the entire outfit&mdash;twenty men
besides Barkwell and Weaver&mdash;left the ranchhouse
and spread, fan-wise, over the plains west of Manti.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>They lost all sense of time. Several of them had
ridden to Manti, making a round of the places that
were still open, but had returned, with no word of
Trevison. Corrigan had claimed to have seen him.
But then, a man told his questioner, Corrigan claimed
Trevison had choked the banker to death. He could
believe both claims, or neither. So far as the man
himself was concerned, he was not going to commit
himself. But if Trevison had done the job, he&#8217;d done
it well. The seekers after information rode out of
Manti on the run. At some time after midnight the
entire outfit was grouped near Clay Levins&#8217; house.</p>
<p>They held a short conference, and then Barkwell rode
forward and hammered on the door of the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re wantin&#8217; Clay, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Barkwell in
answer to the scared inquiry that filtered through the
closed door. &#8220;It&#8217;s the Diamond K outfit.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want him for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We was thinkin&#8217; that mebbe he&#8217;d know where &#8216;Firebrand&#8217;
is. &#8216;Firebrand&#8217; is sort of lost, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The door flew open and Mrs. Levins, like a pale
ghost, appeared in the opening. &#8220;Trevison and Clay
left here tonight. I didn&#8217;t look to see what time. Oh,
I hope nothing has happened to them!&#8221;</p>
<p>They quieted her fears and fled out into the plains
again, charging themselves with stupidity for not being
more diplomatic in dealing with Mrs. Levins. During
the early hours of the morning they rode again to the
Diamond K ranchhouse, thinking that perhaps Trevison
had slipped by them and returned. But Trevison
had not returned, and the outfit gathered in the timber
near the house in the faint light of the breaking dawn,
disgusted, their horses jaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mighty hard work tryin&#8217; to be an outlaw in this
damned dude-ridden country,&#8221; wailed the disappointed
Weaver. &#8220;Outlaws usual have a den or a cave or a
mountain fastness, or somethin&#8217;, anyhow&mdash;accordin&#8217;
to all the literchoor I&#8217;ve read on the subject. If &#8216;Firebrand&#8217;s&#8217;
got one, he&#8217;s mighty bashful about mentionin&#8217;
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord!&#8221; exclaimed Barkwell, weakly. &#8220;My
brains is sure ready for the mourners! Where&#8217;s &#8216;Firebrand&#8217;?
Why, where would you expect a man to be
that&#8217;d burned up a courthouse an&#8217; a bank an&#8217; salivated
a banker? He&#8217;d be hidin&#8217; out, wouldn&#8217;t he, you mis&#8217;able
box-head! Would he come driftin&#8217; back to the home
ranch, an&#8217; come out when them damn deputies come
along, bowin&#8217; an&#8217; scrapin&#8217; an&#8217; sayin&#8217;: &#8216;I&#8217;m here, gentlemen&mdash;I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
been waitin&#8217; for you to come an&#8217; try
rope on me, so&#8217;s you&#8217;d be sure to get a good fit!&#8217; Would
he? You&#8217;re mighty right he&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t! He&#8217;d be
populatin&#8217; that old pueblo that he&#8217;s been tellin&#8217; me for
years would make a good fort!&#8221; His horse leaped as
he drove the spurs in, cruelly, but at the distance of a
hundred yards he was not more than a few feet in
advance of the others&mdash;and they, disregarding the
rules of the game&mdash;were trying to pass him.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t a bit of sense of takin&#8217; any risk,&#8221;
objected Levins from the security of the communal
chamber, as Trevison peered cautiously around a corner
of the adobe house. &#8220;It&#8217;d be just the luck of one
of them critters if they&#8217;d pot you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not thinking of offering myself as a target for
them,&#8221; the other laughed. &#8220;They&#8217;re still there,&#8221; he
added a minute later as he stepped into the chamber.
&#8220;Them shooting you as they did, without warning,
seems to indicate that they&#8217;ve orders to wipe us out,
if possible. They&#8217;re deputies. I bumped into Corrigan
right after I left the bank building, and I suppose
he has set them on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon so. Seems it ain&#8217;t possible, though,&#8221;
Levins added, doubtfully. &#8220;They was here before you
come. Your Nigger horse ain&#8217;t takin&#8217; no dust. I
reckon you didn&#8217;t stop anywheres?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the Bar B.&#8221; Trevison made this admission
with some embarrassment.</p>
<p>But Levins did not reproach him&mdash;he merely
groaned, eloquently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></p>
<p>Trevison leaned against the opening of the chamber.
His muscles ached; he was in the grip of a mighty
weariness. Nature was protesting against the great
strain that he had placed upon her. But his jaws set
as he felt the flesh of his legs quivering; he grinned
the derisive grin of the fighter whose will and courage
outlast his physical strength. He felt a pulse of contempt
for himself, and mingling with it was a strange
elation&mdash;the thought that Rosalind Benham had
strengthened his failing body, had provided it with the
fuel necessary to keep it going for hours yet&mdash;as it
must. He did not trust himself to yield to his passions
as he stood there&mdash;that might have caused him to
grow reckless. He permitted the weariness of his
body to soothe his brain; over him stole a great calm.
He assured himself that he could throw it off any time.</p>
<p>But he had deceived himself. Nature had almost
reached the limit of effort, and the inevitable slow reaction
was taking place. The tired body could be forced
on for a while yet, obeying the lethargic impulses of an
equally tired brain, but the break would come. At this
moment he was oppressed with a sense of the unreality
of it all. The pueblo seemed like an ancient city of his
dreams; the adobe houses details of a weird phantasmagoria;
his adventures of the past forty-eight hours
a succession of wild imaginings which he now reviewed
with a sort of detached interest, as though he had
watched them from afar.</p>
<p>The moonlight shone on him; he heard Levins
exclaim sharply: &#8220;Your arm&#8217;s busted, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He started, swayed, and caught himself, laughing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
lowly, guiltily, for he realized that he had almost fallen
asleep, standing. He held the arm up to the moonlight,
examining it, dropping it with a deprecatory word. He
settled against the wall near the opening again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hell!&#8221; declared Levins, anxiously, &#8220;you&#8217;re all in!&#8221;</p>
<p>Trevison did not answer. He stole along the outside
wall of the adobe house and peered out into the
plains. The men were still where they had been when
the shot had been fired, and the sight of them brought
a cold grin to his face. He backed away from the
corner, dropped to his stomach and wriggled his way
back to the corner, shoving his rifle in front of him.
He aimed the weapon deliberately, and pulled the trigger.
At the flash a smothered cry floated up to him,
and he drew back, the thud of bullets against the adobe
walls accompanying him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That leaves seven, Levins,&#8221; he said grimly. &#8220;Looks
like my trip to Santa Fe is off, eh?&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Well,
I&#8217;ve always had a yearning to be besieged, and I&#8217;ll make
it mighty interesting for those fellows. Do you think
you can cover that slope, so they can&#8217;t get up there
while I&#8217;m reconnoitering? It would be certain death
for me to stick my head around that corner again.&#8221;</p>
<p>At Levins&#8217; emphatic affirmative he was helped to the
shelter of a recess, from where he had a view of the
slope, though himself protected by a corner of one of
the houses; placed a rifle in the wounded man&#8217;s hands,
and carrying his own, vanished into one of the dark
passages that weaved through the pueblo.</p>
<p>He went only a short distance. Emerging from an
opening in one of the adobe houses he saw a parapet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
wall, sadly crumpled in spots, facing the plains, and
he dropped to his hands and knees and crept toward it,
secreting himself behind it and prodding the wall cautiously
with the barrel of his rifle until he found a joint
in the stone work where the adobe mud was rotted.
He poked the muzzle of the rifle through the crevice,
took careful aim, and had the satisfaction of hearing
a savage curse in the instant following the flash. He
threw himself flat immediately, listening to the spatter
and whine of the bullets of the volley that greeted his
shot. They kept it up long&mdash;but when there was a
momentary cessation he crept back to the entrance of
the adobe house, entered, followed another passage and
came out on the ledge farther along the side of the
pueblo. He halted in a dense shadow and looked
toward the spot where the men had been. They had
vanished.</p>
<p>There was nothing to do but to wait, and he sank
behind a huge block of stone in an angle of the ledge,
noting with satisfaction that he could see the slope
that he had set Levins to guard.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the boss of this fort if I don&#8217;t go to sleep,&#8221;
he told himself grimly as he stretched out. He lay
there, watching, while the moonlight faded, while a
gray streak in the east slowly widened, presaging the
dawn. Stretched flat, his aching muscles welcoming
the support of the cool stone of the ledge, he had to
fight off the drowsiness that assailed him.</p>
<p>An hour dragged by. He knew the deputies were
watching, no doubt having separated to conceal themselves
behind convenient boulders that dotted the plains
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
at the foot of the slope. Or perhaps while he had been
in the passages of the pueblo, changing his position,
some of them might have stolen to the numerous crags
and outcroppings of rock at the base of the pueblo.
They might now be massing for a rush up the slope.
But he doubted they would risk the latter move, for they
knew that he must be on the alert, and they had cause
to fear his rifle.</p>
<p>Once he rested his head on his extended right arm,
and the contact was so agreeable that he allowed it to
remain there&mdash;long. He caught himself in time; in
another second he would have been too late. He saw
the figure of a man on the slope a foot or two below
the crest. He was flat on his stomach, no doubt having
crept there during the minutes that Trevison had
been enjoying his rest, and at the instant Trevison saw
him he was raising his rifle, directing it at the recess
where Levins had been left, on guard.</p>
<p>Trevison was wide awake now, and his marksmanship
as deadly as ever. He waited until the man&#8217;s rifle
came to a level. Then his own weapon spat viciously.
The man rose to his knees, reeling. Another rifle
cracked&mdash;from the recess where Levins was concealed,
this time&mdash;and the man sank to the dust of the slope,
rolling over and over until he reached the bottom,
where he stretched out and lay prone. There was a
shout of rage from a section of rock-strewn level near
the foot of the slope, and Trevison&#8217;s lips curled with
satisfaction. The second shot had told him that a fear
he had entertained momentarily was unfounded&mdash;Levins
was apparently quite alive.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<p>He raised himself cautiously, backed away from the
rock behind which he had been concealed, and wheeled,
intending to join Levins. A faint sound reached his
ears from the plains, and he faced around again, to see
a group of horsemen riding toward the pueblo. They
were coming fast, racing ahead of a dust cloud, and
were perhaps a quarter of a mile distant. But Trevison
knew them, and stepped boldly out to the edge
of the stone ledge waving his hat to them, laughing
full-throatedly, his voice vibrating a little as he spoke:</p>
<p>&#8220;Good old Barkwell!&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s him!&#8221;</p>
<p>Barkwell pulled his horse to a sliding halt as he saw
the figure on the pueblo, outlined distinctly in the clear
white light of the dawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s all right!&#8221; he declared to the others as they
followed his example and drew their beasts down.
&#8220;Them&#8217;s some of the scum that&#8217;s been after him,&#8221; he
added as several horsemen swept around the far side
of the pueblo. &#8220;It was them we heard shootin&#8217;.&#8221; The
outfit sat silent on their horses and watched the men
ride over the plains toward another group of horsemen
that the Diamond K men had observed some time
before riding toward the pueblo,</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep!&#8221; Barkwell said, now; &#8220;that other bunch is
deputies, too. It&#8217;s mighty plain. This bunch rounded
up &#8216;Firebrand&#8217; an&#8217; sent some one back for reinforcements.&#8221;
He swept the Diamond K outfit with a snarling
smile. &#8220;They&#8217;re goin&#8217; to need &#8217;em, too! I reckon
we&#8217;d better wait for them to play their hand. It&#8217;s about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
a stand off in numbers. We don&#8217;t stand no slack, boys.
We&#8217;re outlawed already, from the ruckus of last night,
an&#8217; if they start anything we&#8217;ve got to wipe &#8217;em out!
You heard &#8217;em shootin&#8217; at the boss, an&#8217; they ain&#8217;t no
pussy-kitten bunch! I&#8217;ll do the gassin&#8217;&mdash;if there&#8217;s any
to be done&mdash;an&#8217; when I draw, you guys do your
damnedest!&#8221;</p>
<p>The outfit set itself to wait. Over on the edge of
the pueblo they could see Trevison. He was bending
over something, and when they saw him stoop and lift
the object, heaving it to his shoulder and walking away
with it, a sullen murmur ran over the outfit, and lips
grew stiff and white with rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Clay Levins, boys!&#8221; said Barkwell. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
plugged him! Do you reckon we&#8217;ve got to go back
to Levins&#8217; shack an&#8217; tell his wife that we let them
skunks get away after makin&#8217; orphants of her kids?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m jumpin&#8217;!&#8221; shrieked Jud Weaver, his voice coming
chokingly with passion. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t waitin&#8217; one damned
minute for any palaver! Either them deputies is wiped
out, or I am!&#8221; He dug the spurs into his horse, drawing
his six-shooter as the animal leaped.</p>
<p>Weaver&#8217;s horse led the outfit by only three or four
jumps, and they swept over the level like a devastating
cyclone, the spiral dust cloud that rose behind them
following them lazily, sucked along by the wind of
their passing.</p>
<p>The group of deputies had halted; they were sitting
tense and silent in their saddles when the Diamond K
outfit came up, slowing down as they drew nearer, and
halting within ten feet of the others, spreading out in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
a crude semi-circle, so that each man had an unobstructed
view of the deputies.</p>
<p>Barkwell had no chance to talk. Before he could
get his breath after pulling his horse down, Weaver,
his six-shooter in hand, its muzzle directed fairly at
Gieger, who was slightly in advance of his men, fumed
forth:</p>
<p>&#8220;What in hell do you-all mean by tryin&#8217; to herd-ride
our boss? Talk fast, you eagle-beaked turkey
buzzard, or I salivates you rapid!&#8221;</p>
<p>The situation was one of intense delicacy. Gieger
might have averted the threatening clash with a judicious
use of soft, placating speech. But it pleased him
to bluster.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are deputies, acting under orders from the
court. We are after a murderer, and we mean to get
him!&#8221; he said, coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deputies! Hell!&#8221; Barkwell&#8217;s voice rose, sharply
scornful and mocking. &#8220;Deputies! Crooks! Gun-fighters!
Pluguglies!&#8221; His eyes, bright, alert, gleaming
like a bird&#8217;s, were roving over the faces in the
group of deputies. &#8220;A damn fine bunch of guys to
represent the law! There&#8217;s Dakota Dick, there! Tinhorn,
rustler! There&#8217;s Red Classen! Stage robber!
An&#8217; Pepper Ridgely, a plain, ornery thief! An&#8217; Kid
Dorgan, a sneakin&#8217; killer! An&#8217; Buff Keller, an&#8217; Andy
Watts, an&#8217; Pig Mugley, an&#8217;&mdash;oh, hell! Deputies!
Law!&mdash;&mdash;Ah&mdash;hah!&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the men had reached for his holster.
Weaver&#8217;s gun barked twice and the man pitched limply
forward to his horse&#8217;s neck. Other weapons flashed;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
the calm of the early morning was rent by the hoarse,
guttural cries of men in the grip of the blood-lust, the
sustained and venomous popping of pistols, the queer,
sodden impact of lead against flesh, the terror-snorts
of horses, and the grunts of men, falling heavily.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>A big man in khaki, loping his horse up the slope
of an arroyo half a mile distant, started at the sound
of the first shot and raced over the crest. He
pulled the horse to an abrupt halt as his gaze swept
the plains in front of him. He saw riderless horses
running frantically away from a smoking blot, he saw
the blot streaked with level, white smoke-spurts that
ballooned upward quickly; he heard the dull, flat reports
that followed the smoke-spurts.</p>
<p>It seemed to be over in an instant. The blot split
up, galloping horses and yelling men burst out of it.
The big man had reached the crest of the arroyo at the
critical second in which the balance of victory wavers
uncertainly. With thrusting chin, lips in a hideous pout,
and with sullen, blazing eyes, he watched the battle go
against him. Fifteen cowboys&mdash;he counted them, deliberately,
coldly, despite the rage-mania that had seized
him&mdash;were spurring after eight other men whom he
knew for his own. As he watched he saw two of these
tumble from their horses. And at a distance he saw
the loops of ropes swing out to enmesh four more&mdash;who
were thrown and dragged; he watched darkly as
the remaining two raised their hands above their heads.
Then his lips came out of their pout and were wreathed
in a bitter snarl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Licked!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Twelve put out of business.
But there&#8217;s thirty more&mdash;if the damn fools have
come in to town! That&#8217;s two to one!&#8221; He laughed,
wheeled his horse toward Manti, rode a few feet down
the slope of the arroyo, halted and sat motionless in
the saddle, looking back. He smiled with cold satisfaction.
&#8220;Lucky for me that cinch strap broke,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Trevison was placing Levins&#8217; limp form across the
saddle on Nigger&#8217;s back when the faint morning breeze
bore to his ears the report of Weaver&#8217;s pistol. A rattling
volley followed the first report, and Trevison led
Nigger close to the edge of the ledge in time to observe
the battle as Corrigan had seen it. He hurried Nigger
down the slope, but he had to be careful with his burden.
Reaching the level he lifted Levins off, laid him
gently on the top of a huge flat rock, and then leaped
into the saddle and sent Nigger tearing over the plains
toward the scene of the battle.</p>
<p>It was over when he arrived. A dozen men were
lying in the tall grass. Some were groaning, writhing;
others were quiet and motionless. Four or five of
them were arrayed in chaps. His lips grimmed as his
gaze swept them. He dismounted and went to them,
one after another. He stooped long over one.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got Weaver,&#8221; he heard a voice say. And
he started and looked around, and seeing no one near,
knew it was his own voice that he heard. It was dry
and light&mdash;as a man&#8217;s voice might be who has run
far and fast. He stood for a while, looking down at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
Weaver. His brain was reeling, as it had reeled over
on the ledge of the pueblo a few minutes before, when
he had discovered a certain thing. It was not a weakness;
it was a surge of reviving rage, an accession of
passion that made his head swim with its potency, made
his muscles swell with a strength that he had not known
for many hours. Never in his life had he felt more
like crying. His emotions seared his soul as a white-hot
iron sears the flesh; they burned into him, scorching
his pity and his impulses of mercy, withering them,
blighting them. He heard himself whining sibilantly, as
he had heard boys whine when fighting, with eagerness
and lust for blows. It was the insensate, raging fury of
the fight-madness that had gripped him, and he suddenly
yielded to it and raised his head, laughing harshly,
with panting, labored breath.</p>
<p>Barkwell rode up to him, speaking hoarsely: &#8220;We
come pretty near wipin&#8217; &#8217;em out, &#8216;Firebrand!&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked up at his foreman, and the latter&#8217;s face
blanched. &#8220;God!&#8221; he said. He whispered to a cowboy
who had joined him: &#8220;The boss is pretty near loco&mdash;looks
like!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve killed Weaver,&#8221; muttered Trevison.
&#8220;He&#8217;s here. They killed Clay, too&mdash;he&#8217;s down on a
rock near the slope.&#8221; He laughed, and tightened his
belt. The record book which he had carried in his
waistband all along interfered with this work, and he
drew it out, throwing it from him. &#8220;Clay was worth
a thousand of them!&#8221;</p>
<p>Barkwell got down and seized the book, watching
Trevison closely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Boss,&#8221; he said, as Trevison ran to his
horse and threw himself into the saddle; &#8220;you&#8217;re
bushed, mighty near&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>If Trevison heard his first words he had paid no
attention to them. He could not have heard the last
words, for Nigger had lunged forward, running with
great, long, catlike leaps in the direction of Manti.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; yelled Barkwell to some of the men
who had ridden up; &#8220;the damn fool is goin&#8217; to town!
They&#8217;ll salivate him, sure as hell! Some of you stay
here&mdash;two&#8217;s enough! The rest of you come along
with me!&#8221;</p>
<p>They were after Trevison within a few seconds, but
the black horse was far ahead, running without hitch
or stumble, as straight toward Manti as his willing
muscles and his loyal heart could take him.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Corrigan had seen the black bolt that had rushed
toward him out of the spot where the blot had been.
He cursed hoarsely and drove the spurs deep into the
flanks of his horse, and the animal, squealing with pain
and fury, leaped down the side of the arroyo, crossed
the bottom in two or three bounds and stretched away
toward Manti.</p>
<p>A cold fear had seized the big man&#8217;s heart. It made
a sweat break out on his forehead, it caused his hand
to tremble as he flung it around to his hip in search of
his pistol. He tried to shake the feeling off, but it
clung insistently to him, making him catch his breath.
His horse was big, rangy, and strong, but he forced it
to such a pace during the first mile of the ride that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
could feel its muscles quivering under the saddle skirts.
And he looked back at the end of the mile, to see the
black horse at about the same distance from him; possibly
the distance had been shortened. It seemed to
Corrigan that he had never seen a horse that traveled
as smoothly and evenly as the big black, or that ran
with as little effort. He began to loathe the black with
an intensity equaled only by that which he felt for his
rider.</p>
<p>He held his lead for another mile. Glancing back a
little later he noted with a quickening pulse that the
distance had been shortened by several hundred feet,
and that the black seemed to be traveling with as little
effort as ever. Also, for the first time, Corrigan noticed
the presence of other riders, behind Trevison. They
were topping a slight rise at the instant he glanced
back, and were at least a mile behind his pursuer.</p>
<p>At first, mingled with his fear, Corrigan had felt
a slight disgust for himself in yielding to his sudden
panic. He had never been in the habit of running.
He had been as proud of his courage as he had been
of his cleverness and his keenness in planning and plotting.
It had been his mental boast that in every crisis
his nerve was coldest. But now he nursed a vagrant,
furtive hope that waiting for him at Manti would be
some of those men whom he had hired at his own
expense to impersonate deputies. The presence of the
hope was as inexplicable as the fear that had set him
to running from Trevison. Two or three weeks ago
he would have faced both Trevison and his men and
brazened it out. But of late a growing dread of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
man had seized him. Never before had he met a man
who refused to be beaten, or who had fought him as
recklessly and relentlessly.</p>
<p>He jeered at himself as he rode, telling himself that
when Trevison got near enough he would stand and
have it out with him&mdash;for he knew that the fight had
narrowed down between them until it was as Trevison
had said, man to man&mdash;but as he rode his breath came
faster, his backward glances grew more frequent and
fearful, and the cold sweat on his forehead grew
clammy. Fear, naked and shameful, had seized him.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Behind him, lean, gaunt, haggard; seeing nothing
but the big man ahead of him, feeling nothing but an
insane desire to maim or slay him, rode a man who in
forty-eight hours had been transformed from a frank,
guileless, plain-speaking human, to a rage-drunken savage&mdash;a
monomaniac who, as he leaned over Nigger&#8217;s
mane, whispered and whined and mewed, as his forebears,
in some tropical jungle, voiced their passions
when they set forth to slay those who had sought to
despoil them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE DREGS</h3>
</div>

<p>When the Benham private car came to a stop
on the switch, Rosalind swung up the steps and
upon the platform just as J. C., ruddy, smiling and
bland, opened the door. She was in his arms in an
instant, murmuring her joy. He stroked her hair, then
held her off for a good look at her, and inquired,
unctuously:</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing in town so early, my dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; She hid her face on his shoulder, reluctant
to tell him. But she knew he must be told, and so
she steeled herself, stepping back and looking at him,
her heart pounding madly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father; these people have discovered that Corrigan
has been trying to cheat them!&#8221;</p>
<p>She would have gone on, but the sickly, ghastly pallor
of his face frightened her. She swayed and leaned
against the railing of the platform, a sinking, deadly
apprehension gnawing at her, for it seemed from the
expression of J. C.&#8217;s face that he had some knowledge
of Corrigan&#8217;s intentions. But J. C. had been through
too many crises to surrender at the first shot in this one.
Still he got a good grip on himself before he attempted
to answer, and then his voice was low and intoned with
casual surprise:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Trying to cheat them? How, my dear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By trying to take their land from them. You had
no knowledge of it, Father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who has been saying that?&#8221; he demanded, with a
fairly good pretense of righteous anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody. But I thought&mdash;I&mdash;Oh, thank God!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; he bluffed with faint reproach;
&#8220;things are coming to a pretty pass when one&#8217;s own
daughter is the first to suspect him of wrong-doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t, Father. I was merely&mdash;I don&#8217;t know
what I <i>did</i> think! There has been so much excitement!
Everything is <i>so</i> upset! They have blown up the mining
machinery, burned the bank and the courthouse;
Judge Lindman was abducted and found; Braman was
killed&mdash;choked to death; the Vigilantes are&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God!&#8221; Benham interrupted her, staggering
back against the rear of the coach. &#8220;Who has
been at the bottom of all this lawlessness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Trevison.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gasped, in spite of the fact that he had suspected
what her answer would be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Corrigan? Where&#8217;s Trevison?&#8221; He
demanded, his hands shaking. &#8220;Answer me! Where
are they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; the girl returned, dully. &#8220;They
say Trevison is hiding in a pueblo not far from the
Bar B. And that Corrigan left here early this morning,
with a number of deputies, to try to capture him.
And those men&mdash;&#8221; She indicated the horsemen gathered
in front of the <i>Belmont</i>, whom he had not seen,
&#8220;are organizing to go to Trevison&#8217;s rescue. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
have discovered that Corrigan murdered Braman,
though Corrigan accused Trevison.&#8221;</p>
<p>J. C. flattened himself against the rear wall of the
coach and looked with horror upon the armed riders.
There were forty or fifty of them now, and others were
joining the group. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Judge Lindman?&#8221; he
faltered. &#8220;Can&#8217;t this lawlessness be stopped?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is only a few minutes ago that Judge Lindman
was dragged from a shed into which he had been forced
by Corrigan&mdash;after being beaten by him. He made
a public confession of his part in the attempted fraud,
and charged Corrigan with coercing him. Those men
are aroused, Father. I don&#8217;t know what the end will
be, but I am afraid&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid they&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall give the engineer orders to pull my car out
of here!&#8221; J. C.&#8217;s face was chalky white.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; cried the girl, sharply. &#8220;That would
make them think you were&mdash;Don&#8217;t <i>run</i>, Father!&#8221;
she begged, omitting the word which she dreaded to
think might become attached to him should he go away,
now that some of them had seen him. &#8220;We&#8217;ll stand
our ground, Father. If Corrigan has done those things
he deserves to be punished!&#8221; Her lips, white and
stiff, closed firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; he said; &#8220;that&#8217;s right&mdash;we won&#8217;t run.&#8221;
But he drew her inside, despite her objections, and
from a window they watched the members of the Vigilantes
gathering, bristling with weapons, a sinister
and ominous arm of that law which is the dread and
horror of the evil-doer.</p>
<p>There came a movement, concerted, accompanied by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
a low rumble as of waves breaking on a rocky shore.
It brought the girl out of her chair, through the door
and upon the car platform, where she stood, her hands
clasped over her breast, her breath coming gaspingly.
His knees knocking together, his face the ashen gray
of death, Benham stumbled after her. He did not
want to go; did not care to see this thing&mdash;what might
happen&mdash;what his terror told him <i>would</i> happen; but
he was forced out upon the platform by the sheer urge
of a morbid curiosity that there was no denying; it
had laid hold of his soul, and though he cringed and
shivered and tottered, he went out, standing close to
the iron rail, gripping it with hands that grew blueish-white
around the knuckles; watching with eyes that
bulged, his lips twitching over soundless words. For
he could not hold himself guiltless in this thing; it could
not have happened had he tempered his smug complacence
with thoughts of justice. He groaned, gibbering,
for he stood on the brink at this minute, looking down
at the lashing sea of retribution.</p>
<p>The girl paid no attention to him. She was watching
the men down the street. The concerted movement
had come from them. Nearly a hundred riders were
on the move. Lefingwell, huge, grim, led them down
the street toward the private car. For an instant the
girl felt a throb of terror, thinking that they might
have designs on the man who stood at the railing near
her, unable to move&mdash;for he had the same thought.
She murmured thankfully when they wheeled, and without
looking in her direction loped their horses toward
a wide, vacant space between some buildings, which led
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
out into the plains, and through which she had ridden
often when entering Manti. Watching the men, shuddering
at the ominous aspect they presented, she saw
a tremor run through them&mdash;as though they all formed
one body. They came to a sudden stop. She heard a
ripple of sound arise from them, amazement and anticipation.
And then, as though with preconcerted design,
though she had heard no word spoken, the group
divided, splitting asunder with a precision that deepened
the conviction of preconcertedness, ranging themselves
on each side of the open space, leaving it gaping
barrenly, unobstructed&mdash;a stretch of windrowed alkali
dust, deep, light and feathery.</p>
<p>Silence, like a stroke, fell over the town. The girl
saw people running toward the open space, but they
seemed to make no noise&mdash;they might have been dream
people. And then, noting that they all stared in one
direction, she looked over their heads. Not more than
four or five hundred feet from the open space, and
heading directly toward it, thundered a rider on a tall,
strong, rangy horse. The beast&#8217;s chest was foam-flecked,
the white lather that billowed around its muzzle
was stained darkly. But it came on with heart-breaking
effort, giving its rider its all. Behind the first rider
came a second, not more than fifty feet distant from
the other, on a black horse which ran with no effort,
seemingly, sliding along with great, smooth undulations,
his mighty muscles flowing like living things under
his glossy, somber coat.</p>
<p>The girl saw the man on his back leaning forward,
a snarling, terrible grin on his face. She saw the first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
rider wheel when he reached the edge of the open
space near the waiting Vigilantes, bring his horse to a
sliding halt and face toward his pursuer. He clawed at
a hip pocket, drawing a pistol that flashed in the first
rays of the morning sun&mdash;it belched fire and smoke
in a continuous stream, seemingly straight at the rider
of the black horse. One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;six
times! The girl counted. But the first man&#8217;s
hand wabbled, and the rider of the black horse came
on like a demon astride a black bolt, a laugh of bitter
derision on his lips. The black did not swerve. Straight
and true in his headlong flight he struck the other horse.
They went down in a smother of dust, the two horses
grunting, scrambling and kicking. The girl had seen
the rider of the black horse lunge forward at the instant
of impact; he had thrown himself at the other man
as she had seen football players launch themselves at
players of the opposition, and they had both reeled out
of their saddles to disappear in the smother of dust.</p>
<p>Men left the fringe of the living wall flanking the
open space and seized the two horses, leading them
away. The smother drifted, and the girl screamed at
sight of the two raging things that rolled and burrowed
in the deep dust of the street.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>They got up as she watched them, springing apart
hesitating for an awful instant to sob breath into their
lungs; then they rushed together, striking bitter, sledge-hammer
blows that sounded like the smashing of flat
rocks, falling from a great height, on the surface of
water. She shrieked once, wildly, beseeching someone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
to stop them, but no man paid any attention to her cry.
They sat on their horses, silent, tense, grim, and she
settled into a coma of terror, an icy paralysis gripping
her. She heard her father muttering incoherently at
her side, droning and puling something over and over
in a wailing monotone&mdash;she caught it after a while;
he was calling upon his God&mdash;in an hour that could
not have been were it not for his own moral flaccidness.</p>
<p>The dust under the feet of the fighting men leveled
under their shifting, dragging feet; it bore the print
of their bodies where they had lain and rolled in it;
erupting volcanoes belched it heavily upward; it caught
and gripped their legs to the ankles, making their movements
slow and sodden. This condition favored the
larger man. He lashed out a heavy fist that caught
Trevison full and fair on the jaw, and the latter&#8217;s face
turned ashy white as he sank to his knees. Corrigan
stopped to catch his breath before he hurled himself
forward, and this respite, brief as it was, helped the
other to shake off the deadening effect of the blow.
He moved his head slightly as Corrigan swung at it,
and the blow missed, its force pulling the big man off
his feet, so that he tumbled headlong over his adversary.
He was up again in a flash though, for he was
fresher than his enemy. They clinched, and stood
straining, matching strength against strength, sheer,
without trickery, for the madness of murder was in the
heart of one and the desperation of fear in the soul of
the other, and they thought of nothing but to crush
and batter and pound.</p>
<p>Corrigan&#8217;s strength was slightly the greater, but it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
was offset by the other&#8217;s fury. In the clinch the big
man&#8217;s right hand came up, the heel of the palm shoved
with malignant ferocity against Trevison&#8217;s chin. Corrigan&#8217;s
left arm was around Trevison&#8217;s waist, squeezing
it like a vise, and the whole strength of Corrigan&#8217;s
right arm was exerted to force the other&#8217;s head back.
Trevison tried to slip his head sideways to escape the
hold, but the effort was fruitless. Changing his tactics,
his breath lagging in his throat from the terrible
pressure on it, Trevison worked his right hand into
the other&#8217;s stomach with the force and regularity of a
piston rod. The big man writhed under the punishment,
dropping his hand from Trevison&#8217;s chin to his
waist, swung him from his feet and threw him from
him as a man throws a bag of meal.</p>
<p>He was after him before he landed, but the other
writhed and wriggled in the air like a cat, and when the
big man reached for him, trying again to clinch, he
evaded the arm and landed a crushing blow on the
other&#8217;s chin that snapped his head back as though it
were swung from a hinge, and sent him reeling, to his
knees in the dust.</p>
<p>The watching girl saw the ring of men around the
fighters contract; she saw Trevison dive headlong at
the kneeling man; with fingers working in a fury of
impotence she swayed at the iron rail, leaning far over
it, her eyes strained, her breath bated, constricting her
lungs as though a steel band were around them. For
she seemed to feel that the end was near.</p>
<p>She saw them, locked in each other&#8217;s embrace, stagger
to their feet. Corrigan&#8217;s head was wabbling. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
was trying to hold the other to him that he might
escape the lashing blows that were driven at his head.
The girl saw his hold broken, and as he reeled, catching
another blow in the mouth, he swung toward her
and she saw that his lips were smashed, the blood from
them trickling down over his chin. There was a gleam
of wild, despairing terror in his eyes&mdash;revealing the
dawning consciousness of approaching defeat, complete
and terrible. She saw Trevison start another blow,
swinging his fist upward from his knee. It landed with
a sodden squish on the big man&#8217;s jaw. His eyes snapped
shut, and he dropped soundlessly, face down in the dust.</p>
<p>For a space Trevison stood, swaying drunkenly, looking
down at his beaten enemy. Then he drew himself
erect with a mighty effort and swept the crowd with a
glance, the fires of passion still leaping and smoldering
in his eyes. He seemed for the first time to see the
Vigilantes, to realize the significance of their presence,
and as he wheeled slowly his lips parted in a grin of
bitter satisfaction. He staggered around the form of
his fallen enemy, his legs bending at the knees, his
feet dragging in the dust. It seemed to the girl that
he was waiting for Corrigan to get up that he might
resume the fight, and she cried out protestingly. He
wheeled at the sound of her voice and faced her, rocking
back and forth on his heels and toes, and the glow
of dull astonishment in his eyes told her that he was
now for the first time aware of her presence. He
bowed to her, gravely, losing his balance in the effort,
reeling weakly to recover it.</p>
<p>And then a crush of men blotted him out&mdash;the ring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
of Vigilantes had closed around him. She saw Barkwell
lunging through the press to gain Trevison&#8217;s side;
she got a glimpse of him a minute later, near Trevison.
The street had become a sea of jostling, shoving
men and prancing horses. She wanted to get away&mdash;somewhere&mdash;to
shut this sight from her eyes. For
though one horror was over, another impended. She
knew it, but could not move. A voice boomed hoarsely,
commandingly, above the buzz of many others&mdash;it
was Lefingwell&#8217;s, and she cringed at the sound of it.
There was a concerted movement; the Vigilantes were
shoving the crowd back, clearing a space in the center.
In the cleared space two men were lifting Corrigan to
his feet. He was reeling in their grasp, his chin on his
chest, his face dust-covered, disfigured, streaked with
blood. He was conquered, his spirit broken, and her
heart ached with pity for him despite her horror for
his black deeds. The loop of a rope swung out as
she watched; it fell with a horrible swish over Corrigan&#8217;s
head and was drawn taut, swiftly, and a hoarse
roar of approval drowned her shriek.</p>
<p>She heard Trevison&#8217;s voice, muttering in protest,
but his words, like her shriek, were lost in the confusion
of sound. She saw him fling his arms wide, sending
Barkwell and another man reeling from him; he reached
for the pistol at his side and leveled it at the crowd.
Those nearest him shrank, their faces blank with fear
and astonishment. But the man with the rope stood
firm, as did Lefingwell, grim, his face darkening with
wrath.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the law actin&#8217; here, &#8216;Firebrand,&#8217;&#8221; he said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
his voice level. &#8220;You&#8217;ve done your bit, an&#8217; you&#8217;re
due to step back an&#8217; let justice take a hand. This here
skunk has outraged every damned rule of decency an&#8217;
honor. He&#8217;s tried to steal all our land; he&#8217;s corrupted
our court, nearly guzzled Judge Lindman to death,
killed Braman&mdash;an&#8217; Barkwell says the bunch of pluguglies
he hired to pose as deputies, has killed Clay
Levins an&#8217; four or five of the Diamond K men. That&#8217;s
plenty. We&#8217;d admire to give in to you. We&#8217;ll do anything
else you say. But this has got to be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Lefingwell had been talking two of the Vigilantes
had slipped to the rear of Trevison. As Lefingwell
concluded they leaped. The arms of one man
went around Trevison&#8217;s neck; the other man lunged
low and pinned his arms to his sides, one hand grasping
the pistol and wrenching it from his hand. The crowd
closed again. The girl saw Corrigan lifted to the back
of a horse, and she shut her eyes and hung dizzily to
the railing, while tumult and confusion raged around
her.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes a little later, to see Barkwell
and another man leading Trevison into the front door
of the <i>Castle</i>. The street around the car was deserted,
save for two or three men who were watching her curiously.
She felt her father&#8217;s arms around her, and she
was led into the car, her knees shaking, her soul sick
with the horror of it all.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, as she sat at one of the windows,
staring stonily out in the shimmering sunlight of the
street, she saw some of the Vigilantes returning. She
shrank back from the window, shuddering.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>THE CALM</h3>
</div>

<p>The day seemed to endure for an age. Rosalind
did not leave the car; she did not go near her
father, shut up alone in his apartment; she ate nothing,
ignoring the negro attendant when he told her
that lunch was served, huddled in a chair beside an
open window she decided a battle. She saw the forces
of reason and justice rout the hosts of hatred and
crime, and she got up finally, her face pallid, but resolute,
secure in the knowledge that she had decided
wisely. She pitied Corrigan. Had it been within her
power she would have prevented the tragedy. And
yet she could not blame these people. They were playing
the game honestly, and their patience had been
sadly strained by one player who had persisted in breaking
the rules. He had been swept away by his peers,
which was as fair a way as any law&mdash;any human law&mdash;could
deal with him. In her own East he would
have paid the same penalty. The method would have
been more refined, to be sure; there would have been
a long legal squabble, with its tedious delays, but in
the end Corrigan would have paid. There was a retributive
justice for all those who infracted the rules of
the game. It had found Corrigan.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></p>
<p>At three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon she washed her
face. The cool water refreshed her, and with reviving
spirits she combed her hair, brushed the dust from her
clothing, and looked into a mirror. There were dark
hollows under her eyes, a haunting, dreading expression
in them. For she could not help thinking about
what had happened there&mdash;down the street where the
Vigilantes had gone.</p>
<p>She dropped listlessly into another chair beside a
window, this time facing the station. She saw her
horse, hitched to the rail at the station platform, where
she had left it that morning. <i>That</i> seemed to have
been days ago! A period of aching calm had succeeded
the tumult of the morning. The street was soundless,
deserted. Those men who had played leading parts in
the tragedy were not now visible. She would have
deserted the town too, had it not been for her father.
The tragedy had unnerved him, and she must stay
with him until he recovered. She had asked the porter
about him, and the latter had reported that he seemed
to be asleep.</p>
<p>A breeze carried a whisper to her as she sat at the
window:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s &#8216;Firebrand&#8217; now?&#8221; said a voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sleepin&#8217;. The clerk in the <i>Castle</i> says he&#8217;s makin&#8217;
up for lost time.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not bother to try to see the owners of the
voices; her gaze was on the plains, far and vast; and
the sky, clear, with a pearly shimmer that dazzled her.
She closed her eyes. She could not have told how long
she slept. She awoke to the light touch of the porter,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
and she saw Trevison standing in the open doorway
of the car.</p>
<p>The dust of the battle had been removed. An admiring
barber had worked carefully over him; a doctor
had mended his arm. Except for a noticeable thinness
of the face, and a certain drawn expression of
the eyes, he was the same Trevison who had spoken
so frankly to her one day out on the plains when he
had taken her into his confidence. In the look that he
gave her now was the same frankness, clouded a little,
she thought, by some emotion&mdash;which she could
not fathom.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come to apologize,&#8221; he said; &#8220;for various
unjust thoughts with which I have been obsessed.&#8221;
Before she could reply he had taken two or three swift
steps and was standing over her, and was speaking again,
his voice vibrant and regretful: &#8220;I ought to have
known better than to think&mdash;what I did&mdash;of you. I
have no excuses to make, except that I was insane with
a fear that my ten years of labor and lonesomeness were
to be wasted. I have just had a talk with Hester Harvey,
and she has shown me what a fool I have been.
She&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosalind got up, laughing lowly, tremulously. &#8220;I
talked with Hester this morning. And I think&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She told you&mdash;&#8221; he began, his voice leaping.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many things.&#8221; She looked straight at him, her
eyes glowing, but they drooped under the heat of his.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to feel elated over it&mdash;there were
two of us.&#8221; She felt that the surge of joy that ran
over her would have shown in her face had it not been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
for a sudden recollection of what the Vigilantes had
done that morning. That recollection paled her cheeks
and froze the smile on her lips.</p>
<p>He was watching her closely and saw her face harden.
A shadow passed over his own. He thought he could
see the hopelessness of staying longer. &#8220;A woman&#8217;s
love,&#8221; he said, gloomily, &#8220;is a wonderful thing. It
clings through trouble and tragedy&mdash;never faltering.&#8221;
She looked at him, startled, trying to solve the enigma
of this speech. He laughed, bitterly. &#8220;That&#8217;s what
makes a woman superior to mere man. Love exalts
her. It makes a savage of a man. I suppose it is
&#8216;good-bye.&#8217;&#8221; He held out a hand to her and she took
it, holding it limply, looking at him in wonderment, her
heart heavy with regret. &#8220;I wish you luck and happiness,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Corrigan is a man in spite of&mdash;of
many faults. You can redeem him; you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Is</i> a man!&#8221; Her hand tightened on his; he could
feel her tremble. &#8220;Why&mdash;why&mdash;I thought&mdash;Didn&#8217;t
they&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t they tell you? The fools!&#8221; He laughed
derisively. &#8220;They let him go. They knew I wouldn&#8217;t
want it. They did it for me. He went East on the
noon train&mdash;quite alive, I assure you. I am glad of
it&mdash;for your sake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For my sake!&#8221; Her voice lifted in mingled joy
and derision, and both her hands were squeezing his
with a pressure that made his blood leap with a longing
to possess her. &#8220;For <i>my</i> sake!&#8221; she repeated, and the
emphasis made him gasp and stiffen. &#8220;For <i>your</i> sake&mdash;for
both of us, Trevison! Oh, what fools we were!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
What fools all people are, not to trust and believe!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; He drew her toward him,
roughly, and held her hands in a grip that made her
wince. But she looked straight at him in spite of the
pain, her eyes brimming with a promise that he could
not mistake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you <i>see</i>?&#8221; she said to him, her voice quavering;
&#8220;<i>must </i> I tell you?&#8221;</p>
